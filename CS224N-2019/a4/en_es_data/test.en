You know, what I do is write for children,  and I'm probably America's  most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people  that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,  and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you  about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany  is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block  to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle  that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s  in high school in Stow, Ohio  where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody  every week in the boys' room,  until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom  in the teachers' lounge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,  and I ended up in San Francisco, California --  met a lover --  and back in the '80s, found it necessary  to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago,  I got a phone call in the middle of the night  from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,  who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disappointed  that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio,  and please bring that man  that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention  that I have pancreatic cancer,  and I'd like you to please  be quick about this."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there,  and we took care of her  and watched over her family,  because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult  got to know me,  she turned into a box of ashes  and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened  was the circle had closed,  it had become a circle --  and that epiphany I talked about  presented itself.
The epiphany is  that death is a part of life.
She saved my life;  I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything  that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty,  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs --  it needs dignity,  love and pleasure,  and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
As an artist,  connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articulate  that humans are not separate from nature  and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,  where I saw my first icebergs.
I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
The icebergs around me  were almost 200 feet out of the water,  and I could only help but wonder  that this was one snowflake  on top of another snowflake,  year after year.
Icebergs are born  when they calve off of glaciers  or break off of ice shelves.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way  of interacting with their environment  and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up  and hold on to the bitter end,  while others can't take it anymore  and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,  that they're isolated,  that they're separate and alone,  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an iceberg melts,  I am breathing in  its ancient atmosphere.
As the iceberg melts,  it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water  that nourishes many forms of life.
I approach photographing these icebergs  as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,  knowing that in these individual moments  they exist in that way  and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they melt;  it is not an end,  but a continuation  of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --  a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice  is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you  are of an iceberg that I photographed  in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
It's a very rare occasion  that you get to actually witness  an iceberg rolling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention  to the shape of the iceberg  and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll,  and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
It's about 120 feet above the water,  or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
And just like that,  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay?
So two couples each conceiving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.
So just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenario,  I want to imagine that, in one case,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
Both are viable; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two hats  in most of what I do.
As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.
In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.
So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.
And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female.
So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.
Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.
Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.
Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.
Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  "Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?"
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.
So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.
What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?
And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --  about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
And it makes me tense  from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,  and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.
They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part  because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.
They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.
So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way  the Civil Rights movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years afterward?
And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  where we found people like Sojourner Truth  talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"
We find men  on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, "I am a man."
Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.
Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.
So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are  and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.
Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.
Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.
Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.
And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  as our science gets to be so good  in looking at anatomy,  that we reach the point where we have to admit  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?
I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere."
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example,  Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.
But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,  but on the content of their character,"  moving beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of character?
I also want to point out  that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,  because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know  that are probably more deserving of social services  than some humans I know.
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know  that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions  about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.
So how do we operationalize  the question of content of character?
It turns out to be really difficult.
And part of me also wonders,  what if content of character  turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --  able to be seen with an fMRI?
Do we really want to go there?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be really important  to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead  of thinking about this issue of democracy.
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,  and I think we would do a good job in the future.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men  is liable to be murdered,  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,  in which case he's allowed to live.
We don't have that kind of situation.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with --  a surgeon I talked to a few years ago  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins  in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
But when I was on the phone with him,  asking why he was going to do this surgery --  this was a very high-risk surgery --  his answer was that, in this other nation,  these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum  instead of a separation surgery?"
The United States has offered tremendous possibility  for allowing people to be the way they are,  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be in the lead.
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you  that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.
And I want to think about the possibilities  of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,  if we had more involved the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,  and that is that I think that there may be  different kinds of insights  that can come from different kinds of anatomies,  particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex,  I've also been interested in sex difference research.
And one of the things that I've been really interested in  is looking at the differences between males and females  in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies  is that females, on average --  not everyone, but on average --  are more inclined to be very attentive  to complex social relations  and to taking care of people  who are basically vulnerable within the group.
And so if we think about that,  we have an interesting situation on our hands.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school,  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism --  I considered myself a feminist, as I still do --  asked a really strange question.
He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism."
And I thought, "Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,  so there's nothing feminine about feminism."
But the more I thought about his question,  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
That is to say, there might be something, on average,  different about female brains from male brains  that makes us more attentive  to deeply complex social relationships  and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.
So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive  to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,  it's possible that if we injected more mothers  into this concept,  what we would have is more of a concept  of, not just how to protect,  but how to care for each other.
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,  when we take democracy beyond anatomy,  is to think less about the individual body,  in terms of the identity,  and think more about those relationships.
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,  we're thinking about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007,  I decided that we needed to reconceptualize  how we thought about economic development.
Our new goal should be  that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,  they should be able to choose between  at least a handful  of different cities  that were all competing to attract new residents.
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.
There are billions of people in developing countries  who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities  is they're worth so much more  than it costs to build them.
So we could easily supply the world  with dozens, maybe hundreds,  of new cities.
Now this might sound preposterous to you  if you've never thought about new cities.
But just substitute apartment building for cities.
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;  the other half aren't there yet.
You could try and expand the capacity  by doing additions on all the existing apartments.
But you know what you'd run into  is those apartments and the surrounding areas  have rules to avoid discomfort  and the distractions of construction.
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.
But you could go out someplace brand new,  build a brand new apartment building,  as long as the rules there  were ones that facilitated construction  rather than getting in the way.
So I proposed  that governments create new reform zones  big enough to hold cities  and gave them a name: charter cities.
Later I learned that at about this same time,  Javier and Octavio  were thinking about the challenge of reform  in Honduras.
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year  would leave to go to the United States,  and they wanted to ask, what could they do  to make sure that those people could stay  and do the same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009,  Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.
At the next regularly scheduled election,  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide  on a platform that promised reform,  but reconciliation as well.
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
Meanwhile, I was getting ready  to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of refinement,  trial and error, a lot of user testing,  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city  down to the bare essentials.
The first point was the importance of rules,  like those rules that say  you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,  and it's usually the rules that hold us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala  sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to Javier.
They called me.
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami,  in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point  about how valuable cities are,  how much more valuable they are than they cost.
And I used this slide  showing how valuable the raw land is  in a place like New York City:  notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,  per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract discussion,  and at some point when there was a pause,  Octavio said,  "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,  a charter city is a place  where you start with uninhabited land,  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there  and then a chance for people to opt in,  to go live under those rules or not.
So I was asked by the president of Honduras  who said that we need to do this project,  this is important,  this could be the way forward for our country.
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa  and talk again on January fourth and fifth.
So I presented  another fact-filled lecture  that included a slide like this,  which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,  it has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver,  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.
This airport alone  covers more than 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,  if you build a new city,  you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.
Everybody applauded politely.
The faces in the audience  were very serious and attentive.
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,  "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
I've got it here on my laptop."
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.
And it got to the essence,  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to  which could be in Honduras,  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.
And it also involved new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras  would need help from partner countries,  who could benefit from partner countries  who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,  so everybody can trust  that the charter really will be enforced.
We went and looked at a site.
This picture's from there.
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution  to have a constitutional provision  that allows for special development regions.
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment  was 124 to one.
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.
On February 17th they passed it again  with another vote of 114 to one.
Immediately after that vote,  on February 21st to the 24th,  a delegation of about 30 Hondurans  went to the two places in the world  that are most interested in getting into the city building business.
One is South Korea.
This is a picture of a big, new city center  that's being built in South Korea --  bigger than downtown Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years,  after they spent four years getting the permits.
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.
They've actually built two cities already in China  and are preparing the third.
So if you think about this practically,  here's where we are.
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
They're putting in place a legal system  that could allow for managers to come in,  and also an external legal system.
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court  be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.
There's designers and builders of cities  who are very interested.
They even can bring with them some financing.
But the one thing you know they've already solved  is that there's lots of tenants.
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,  especially in a place with a free trade zone,  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
Around the world, there's 700 million people  who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.
There's a million a year  who leave Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of these are a father  who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --  sometimes a single mother  who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.
Sadly, sometimes there are even children  who are trying to get reunited with their parents  that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
So what kind of an idea is it  to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?
Or to build a dozen of these,  or a hundred of these, around the world?
What kind of an idea is it  to think about insisting  that every family have a choice of several cities  that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends from Honduras  asked me to say thank you, TED.
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
But before I show you what I've got inside,  I'm going to make a very public confession,  and that is,  I'm outfit-obsessed.
I love finding, wearing,  and more recently,  photographing and blogging  a different, colorful, crazy outfit  for every single occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes secondhand  from flea markets and thrift stores.
Aww, thank you.
Secondhand shopping  allows me to reduce the impact  my wardrobe has on the environment  and on my wallet.
I get to meet all kinds of great people;  my dollars usually go to a good cause;  I look pretty unique;  and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my size?
Will I like the color?
Will it be under $20?
If all the answers are yes,  I feel as though I've won.
I want to get back to my suitcase  and tell you what I packed  for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants  and that's it.
Exactly one week's worth of undies  is all I put in my suitcase.
I was betting that I'd be able to find  everything else I could possible want to wear  once I got here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me  as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --    that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
Does that sound good?
So as I do this,  I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons  that, believe it or not, I have picked up  in these adventures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sunday.
I call this "Shiny Tiger."
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
This whole outfit, including the jacket,  cost me $55,  and it was the most expensive thing  that I wore the entire week.
Monday: Color is powerful.
It is almost physiologically impossible  to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
If you are happy,  you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tuesday:  Fitting in is way overrated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life  trying to be myself  and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,  they will not only get it,  they will appreciate it.
Wednesday:  Embrace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me  that I look like I'm playing dress-up,  or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
I like to smile  and say, "Thank you."
Thursday:  Confidence is key.
If you think you look good in something,  you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something,  you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30  that I really got what this meant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person  inside and out,  there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:  Gold sequins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday:  Developing your own unique personal style  is a really great way to tell the world something about you  without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again  as people have walked up to me this week  simply because of what I'm wearing,  and we've had great conversations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit  back in my tiny suitcase.
So before I go home to Brooklyn,  I'm going to donate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week  is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things  because around the corner,  there is always going to be  another crazy, colorful,  shiny outfit  just waiting for me,  if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain,  and your brain can be broken into two parts.
There's the left half, which is the logical side,  and then the right half,  which is the intuitive.
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,  then we can plot our brain.
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.
So where would you put your brain on this scale?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,  but I think for most people in the audience,  your brain is something like this --  with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
You can be logical and intuitive.
And so I consider myself one of these people,  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,  who need a good deal of logic  to string together these complex ideas.
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition  to actually make the experiments work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,  and then we develop our intuition from there.
And really you do the same thing.
So some intuition  that you may have developed over the years  is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think about  one thing being in two different places at the same time,  but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,  and that they stay in one place.
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,  unless you're a particle physicist.
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,  because they don't play with car stops,  they play with these little weird particles.
And when they play with their particles,  they find they do all sorts of really weird things --  like they can fly right through walls,  or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote down all these observations,  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;  you needed quantum mechanics  to describe little, tiny particles.
But you didn't need it  to describe the large, everyday objects around us.
This didn't really sit well with my intuition,  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
Well, I play with them sometimes,  but not very often.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
Because if everything is made up of little particles  and all the little particles  follow quantum mechanics,  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing  if we could somehow show  that an everyday object  also follows quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
So I made one.
This is the first object  that you can see  that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.
So what we're looking at here  is a tiny computer chip.
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
This is a photograph of the object.
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,  and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
And so I made this thing  in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --  to make this swimming pool-shaped hole  underneath the device.
This device has the ability  to be in a quantum superposition,  but it needs a little help to do it.
Here, let me give you an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,  but then other people get on board  and I stop doing those things  because I don't want to bother them,  or, frankly, scare them.
So quantum mechanics says  that inanimate objects feel the same way.
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects  are not just people,  but it's also the light shining on it  and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
And so we knew, if we wanted to see  this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
And so that's what we did.
We turned off the lights,  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,  and then we cooled it down  to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
Now, all alone in the elevator,  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --  like expanding and contracting bellows.
And by giving it a gentle nudge,  we were able to make it both vibrate  and not vibrate  at the same time --  something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
What does it mean for one thing  to be both vibrating and not vibrating  at the same time?
So let's think about the atoms.
So in one case:  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal  are sitting still  and at the same time those same atoms  are moving up and down.
Now it's only at precise times when they align.
The rest of the time they're delocalized.
That means that every atom  is in two different places at the same time,  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal  is in two different places.
I think this is really cool.
Really.
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years  because, check this out,  the difference in scale  between a single atom and that chunk of metal  is about the same as the difference  between that chunk of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,  that chunk of metal can be in two different places,  then why not you?
I mean, this is just my logical side talking.
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,  what would that be like?
How would your consciousness  handle your body being delocalized in space?
There's one more part to the story.
It's when we warmed it up,  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
And so I had to develop this new intuition,  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator  are really just quantum objects  just crammed into a tiny space.
You hear a lot of talk  about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.
Well, that's not quite right.
It's more than that; it's deeper.
It's that those connections,  your connections to all the things around you,  literally define who you are,  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amit.
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,  and I pitched this idea  of doing something with museums and art  to my boss who's actually here,  and she allowed me to do it.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,  with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,  and it's access.
And I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --  but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,  I started learning a lot.
And while working at Google,  I tried to put this desire  to make it more accessible with technology together.
So we formed a team, a great team of people,  and we started doing this.
I'm going to probably get into the demo  and then tell you a couple of the interesting things  we've had since launch.
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
You look around at all these museums here.
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,  the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Two ways of going in -- very simple.
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.
It doesn't matter where you are --  Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
You move around, you have fun.
You want to navigate around the museum?
Open the plan up,  and, in one click, jump.
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
Keep going. Have fun.
Explore.
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,  "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
I see this plus sign.
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
Now this is one of the images.
So this is all of the meta-data information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art,  you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.
And this is one of these images that we captured  in what we call gigapixel technology.
So this image, for example,  has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
And I get a lot of people asking me:  "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.
You can zoom around very simply.
You see some fun stuff happening here.
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.
But then you really want to go deep.
And so I started playing around,  and I found something going on over here.
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."
Went in, and I started noticing  that these kids were actually beating something.
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,  and actually found out that this is a game  called squall,  which involves beating a goose with a stick  on Shrove Tuesday.
And apparently it was quite popular.
I don't know why they did it,  but I learned something about it.
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
Now just to give you some perspective,  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
Here is where we were,  and this is the painting.
The best is yet to come -- so in a second.
So now let's just quickly  jump into the MoMA, again in New York.
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.
But what if you want to see brush strokes?
And what if you want to see  how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
You zoom in. You really go in.
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,  and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "The Starry Night,"  I think, never seen like this before.
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
Any one of you, anybody --  doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,  if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.
You can go and create your own museum online --  create your own collection across all these images.
Very simply, you go in --  and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --  you can just zoom around.
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends  and really get a conversation going  about what you're feeling  when you go through these masterpieces.
So I think, in conclusion,  for me, the main thing  is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
I probably shouldn't say that.
It really comes from these artists.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium  that we do justice to their artwork  and represent it properly online.
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays  is, "Did you do this  to replicate the experience of going to a museum?"
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,  and every boy in Italy grows up  with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --  but the reason I'm showing you this  is that something very interesting  happened in Formula 1 racing  over the past couple of decades.
Now some time ago,  if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,  you take a budget, and you bet your budget  on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
This is what, in engineering terms,  you would call a real time control system.
And basically, it's a system made of two components --  a sensing and an actuating component.
What is interesting today  is that real time control systems  are starting to enter into our lives.
Our cities, over the past few years,  just have been blanketed  with networks, electronics.
They're becoming like computers in open air.
And, as computers in open air,  they're starting to respond in a different way  to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,  but they are 50 percent of the world's population.
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --  up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
Beyond cities,  all of this sensing and actuating  is entering our everyday objects.
That's from an exhibition that  Paola Antonelli is organizing  at MoMA later this year, during the summer.
It's called "Talk to Me."
Well our objects, our environment  is starting to talk back to us.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there  were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans  with the environment out there.
In a certain sense,  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,  at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --  actually you can still see a small chip underneath --  and said, shouted,  "Perch non parli? Why don't you talk?"
Well today, for the first time,  our environment is starting to talk back to us.
And I'll show just a few examples --  again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
Let's starting with sensing.
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you  is actually one of the first projects by our lab.
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,  and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
And anyway, Italy won at the end.
Now look at what happened that day  just by monitoring activity  happening on the network.
Here you see the city.
You see the Colosseum in the middle,  the river Tiber.
It's morning, before the match.
You see the timeline on the top.
Early afternoon,  people here and there,  making calls and moving.
The match begins -- silence.
France scores. Italy scores.
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second half. End of normal time.
First overtime, second.
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.
Italy wins. Yeah.
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
You saw the big peak.
The following day, again everybody went to the center  to meet the winning team  and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody moved down.
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,  where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,  to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today  in a way that we couldn't have done  just a few years ago.
Another quick example about sensing:  it's not about people,  but about things we use and consume.
Well today, we know everything  about where our objects come from.
This is a map that shows you  all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project,  we actually developed some small tags  to track trash as it moves through the system.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers  who helped us in Seattle,  just over a year ago,  to tag what they were throwing away --  different types of things, as you can see here --  things they would throw away anyway.
Then we put a little chip, little tag,  onto the trash  and then started following it.
Here are the results we just obtained.
From Seattle ...
after one week.
With this information we realized  there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
This data was not available before.
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
But the other thing is that we believe  that if we see every day  that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,  it's still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
And if we show that to people,  then we can also promote some behavioral change.
So that was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,  he could tell you much more about sensing  and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,  but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,  and that's actuating our environment.
And the first project  is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
It started with a question by the mayor of the city,  who came to us saying  that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition  of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was: How could technology, new technology,  be added to that?
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop  was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,  solenoid valves, taps,  opening and closing.
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
If those pixels fall,  you can write on it,  you can show patterns, images, text.
And even you can approach it, and it will open up  to let you jump through,  as you see in this image.
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
He liked it very much.
And we got a commission to design a building  at the entrance of the expo.
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
There's no doors or windows,  but when you approach it,  it will open up to let you in.
The roof also is covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind,  if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
Or you could close the building,  and the whole architecture will disappear,  like in this case.
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,  when they take the roof down,  of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,  the architecture almost disappears.
Here's the building working.
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
And here was myself trying not to get wet,  testing the sensors that open the water.
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night  when all of the sensors stopped working.
But actually that night, it was even more fun.
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,  because the way of engaging with the building became something different.
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,  and you had to jump without getting wet.
(Crowd Noise)  And that was, for us, was very interesting,  because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,  we always think about how people will use the things we design.
But then reality's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things  that are used and interact with people.
Here is an image then of the building  with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,  and then projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about  the following project I'll show you now.
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters  that move in the air,  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --  almost as a cloud that can move in space.
Here is the video.
So imagine one helicopter,  like the one we saw before,  moving with others,  in synchrony.
So you can have this cloud.
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --  a regular configuration in two dimensions.
Or in regular, but in three dimensions,  where the thing that changes is the light,  not the pixels' position.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine your screen could just appear  in different scales or sizes,  different types of resolution.
But then the whole thing can be  just a 3D cloud of pixels  that you can approach and move through it  and see from many, many directions.
Here is the real Flyfire  control and going down to form the regular grid as before.
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.
You can have each pixel  having an input that comes from people,  from people's movement, or so and so.
I want to show you something here for the first time.
We've been working with Roberto Bolle,  one of today's top ballet dancers --  the toile at Metropolitan in New York  and La Scala in Milan --  and actually captured his movement in 3D  in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
And here you can see Roberto dancing.
You see on the left the pixels,  the different resolutions being captured.
It's both 3D scanning in real time  and motion capture.
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.
You can go all the way through.
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them  and play with color and movement  and gravity and rotation.
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs  for Flyfire.
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
It's called The Cloud.
And the idea here is, imagine, again,  we can involve people  in doing something and changing our environment --  almost to impart what we call cloud raising --  like barn raising, but with a cloud.
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
And I think what is remarkable  that has happened over the past couple of years  is that, over the past couple of decades,  we went from the physical world to the digital one.
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,  and making that accessible through the Internet.
Now today, for the first time --  and the Obama campaign showed us this --  we can go from the digital world,  from the self-organizing power of networks,  to the physical one.
This can be, in our case,  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be,  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --  think about climate change or CO2 emissions --  how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
So the idea that we can actually involve people  in doing this thing together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,  in the same way as the real cloud  is a cloud made of particles.
And those particles are water,  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.
You can actually see from underneath,  sharing the main moments  for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,  and really using it as a way to connect with the community.
So both the physical cloud in the sky  and something you can go to the top [of],  like London's new mountaintop.
You can enter inside it.
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --  but most importantly,  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
Thank you.
How would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I said  that, with just a few changes in your genes,  you could get a better memory --  more precise,  more accurate and quicker.
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,  with more stamina.
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?
How about living longer with good health?
Or perhaps you're one of those  who's always yearned for more creativity.
Which one would you like the most?
Which would you like, if you could have just one?
(Audience Member: Creativity.)  Creativity.
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hands. Let me see.
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.
That's very good.
How many would opt for memory?
Quite a few more.
How about fitness?
A few less.
What about longevity?
Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have any one of these,  it would be a very different world.
Is it just imaginary?
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?
Evolution has been a perennial topic  here at the TED Conference,  but I want to give you today  one doctor's take on the subject.
The great 20th-century geneticist,  T.G. Dobzhansky,  who was also a communicant  in the Russian Orthodox Church,  once wrote an essay that he titled  "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense  Except in the Light of Evolution."
But if you do accept  biological evolution,  consider this:  is it just about the past,  or is it about the future?
Does it apply to others,  or does it apply to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch,  way out on one end,  is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
We branch off of a common ancestor  to modern chimpanzees  about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval,  there have been perhaps 20 or 25  different species of hominids.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
It may seem like we're quite remote  from other parts of this tree of life,  but actually, for the most part,  the basic machinery of our cells  is pretty much the same.
Do you realize that we can take advantage  and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium  to produce the protein of human insulin  used to treat diabetics?
This is not like human insulin;  this is the same protein  that is chemically indistinguishable  from what comes out of your pancreas.
And speaking of bacteria,  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut  more bacteria  than there are cells in the rest of our body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean think of it,  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,  do you think about the bacteria?
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment  for those bacteria.
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,  it's very cozy.
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want  with no effort on their part.
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,  with the occasional interruption  of the unintended forced rush to the exit.
But otherwise,  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,  just as they are essential to your life.
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,  and they protect you against certain diseases.
But what will come in the future?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise  as a species?
Or, are we destined  to become something different --  something, perhaps, even better adapted  to the environment?
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,  life on Earth is like a brief measure;  the animal kingdom,  like a single measure;  and human life,  a small grace note.
That was us.
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,  so I hope you enjoyed it.
Now when I was a freshman in college,  I took my first biology class.
I was fascinated  by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I became enamored of the power of evolution,  and I realized something very fundamental:  in most of the existence of life  in single-celled organisms,  each cell simply divides,  and all of the genetic energy of that cell  is carried on in both daughter cells.
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,  things start to change.
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.
And very importantly,  with the introduction of sexual reproduction  that passes on the genome,  the rest of the body  becomes expendable.
In fact, you could say  that the inevitability of the death of our bodies  enters in evolutionary time  at the same moment  as sexual reproduction.
Now I have to confess,  when I was a college undergraduate,  I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --  it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,  but with each passing year,  I've come to have increasing doubts.
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,  who was performing still in Las Vegas  well into his 90s.
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
He answers the door.
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
She looks at him and says,  "I'm here for super sex."
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."
I came to realize,  as a physician,  that I was working toward a goal  which was different from the goal of evolution --  not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore health from disease.
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
Evolution is all about passing on the genome  to the next generation,  adapting and surviving  through generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view,  you and I are like the booster rockets  designed to send the genetic payload  into the next level of orbit  and then drop off into the sea.
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed  when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to achieve it through not dying."
Evolution does not necessarily  favor the longest-lived.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest  or the strongest or the fastest,  and not even the smartest.
Evolution favors  those creatures best adapted  to their environment.
That is the sole test  of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean,  bacteria that are thermophilic  and can survive at the steam vent heat  that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,  sous-vide cooked fish,  nevertheless, have managed  to make that a hospitable environment for them.
So what does this mean,  as we look back at what has happened in evolution,  and as we think about the place again  of humans in evolution,  and particularly as we look ahead  to the next phase,  I would say  that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not evolve.
We have reached  a kind of equipoise.
And the reasoning behind that would be,  first, we have, through medicine,  managed to preserve a lot of genes  that would otherwise be selected out  and be removed from the population.
And secondly, we as a species  have so configured our environment  that we have managed to make it adapt to us  as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate  and intermix so much  that you can't any longer  have the isolation that is necessary  for evolution to take place.
A second possibility  is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,  natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be  that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,  but they are inexorable.
And as far as isolation goes,  when we as a species  do colonize distant planets,  there will be the isolation and the environmental changes  that could produce evolution  in the natural way.
But there's a third possibility,  an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.
I call it neo-evolution --  the new evolution  that is not simply natural,  but guided and chosen  by us as individuals  in the choices that we will make.
Now how could this come about?
How could it be possible that we would do this?
Consider, first, the reality  that people today, in some cultures,  are making choices about their offspring.
They're, in some cultures,  choosing to have more males than females.
It's not necessarily good for the society,  but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.
Think also,  if it were possible ever  for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,  but for you in your body  to make the genetic adjustments  that would cure or prevent diseases.
What if you could make the genetic changes  to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's  or reduce the risk of cancer  or eliminate stroke?
Wouldn't you want  to make those changes  in your genes?
If we look ahead,  these kind of changes  are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project  started in 1990,  and it took 13 years.
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.
The year after it was finished in 2004,  you could do the same job  for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
Today, you can have a complete sequence  of the three billion base pairs in the human genome  at a cost of about 20,000 dollars  and in the space of about a week.
It won't be very long  before the reality will be  the 1,000-dollar human genome,  and it will be increasingly available for everyone.
These changes are coming.
The same technology  that has produced the human insulin in bacteria  can make viruses  that will not only protect you against themselves,  but induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe it or not,  there's an experimental trial going on  with vaccine against influenza  that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?
These are all reality today,  and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.
Imagine then  just two other little changes.
You can change the cells in your body,  but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?
What if you could change the sperm and the ova,  or change the newly fertilized egg,  and give your offspring a better chance  at a healthier life --  eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,  reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children?
And then, that same analytic technology,  that same engine of science  that can produce  the changes to prevent disease,  will also enable us  to adopt super-attributes,  hyper-capacities --  that better memory.
Why not have the quick wit  of a Ken Jennings,  especially if you can augment it  with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have the quick twitch muscle  that will enable you to run faster and longer?
Why not live longer?
These will be irresistible.
And when we are at a position  where we can pass it on to the next generation,  and we can adopt the attributes we want,  we will have converted  old-style evolution  into neo-evolution.
We'll take a process  that normally might require 100,000 years,  and we can compress it down to a thousand years --  and maybe even in the next 100 years.
These are choices  that your grandchildren,  or their grandchildren,  are going to have before them.
Will we use these choices  to make a society that is better,  that is more successful, that is kinder?
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes  that we want for some of us  and not for others of us?
Will we make a society  that is more boring and more uniform,  or more robust and more versatile?
These are the kinds of questions  that we will have to face.
And most profoundly of all,  will we ever be able to develop the wisdom,  and to inherit the wisdom,  that we'll need to make these choices wisely?
For better or worse,  and sooner than you may think,  these choices will be up to us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack.
It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D.
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.
So I looked at them right away,  and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds."
The pilot had already turned the plane around,  and we weren't that far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later,  three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
He turns off the engines.
Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound.
And then he says three words.
The most unemotional three words I've ever heard.
He says, "Brace for impact."
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
Life was over.
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in an instant.
We have this bucket list,  we have these things we want to do in life,  and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,  all the fences I wanted to mend,  all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on,  I came up with a saying,  which is, "I collect bad wines."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.
I no longer want to postpone anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day --  and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge,  which was by not a lot --    I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret.
I've lived a good life.
In my own humanity and mistakes,  I've tried to get better at everything I tried.
But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.
And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter  with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife,  with my friends, with people.
And after, as I reflected on that,  I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.
It feels great.
I no longer try to be right;  I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned --  and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13."
You can see the water coming.
I'm saying, "Please blow up."
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces  like you've seen in those documentaries.
And as we're coming down,  I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness really framed in one thought,  which is, I only wish for one thing.
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter --  first-grader, not much artistic talent --      And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid.
And it made all the sense in the world to me.
I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots,  that the only thing that matters in my life  is being a great dad.
Above all, above all,  the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.
I was given the gift of a miracle,  of not dying that day.
I was given another gift,  which was to be able to see into the future  and come back  and live differently.
I challenge you guys that are flying today,  imagine the same thing happens on your plane --  and please don't --  but imagine, and how would you change?
What would you get done  that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever?
How would you change your relationships  and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?
Thank you.
I have had the distinct blessing in my life  to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
But the coolest I ever worked on  was around this guy.
This guy's name is TEMPT.
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.
And he came up home from a run one day  and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."
And that was the onset of ALS.
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.
He only has use of his eyes.
I was exposed to him.
I have a company that does design and animation,  so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part  of what we admire and respect in the art world.
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor  Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father  and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?"
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him  and him to be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --  don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate  via these devices?"
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and  you've got really amazing insurance,  you can't actually do that.
These devices aren't accessible to people."
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?"
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?"
That's how they communicate --  so run their finger along.
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?"
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,  and instead, I wrote a check  that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --  I'm like, "All right, here's the deal:  Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,  and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him  isn't able to communicate it."
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.
I met these guys called GRL,  Graffiti Research Lab,  and they have a technology  that allows them to project a light onto any surface  and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,  and it just registers the negative space.
So they go around and do art installations like this.
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.
First it starts with the sexual organs,  then it starts with cuss words,  then it was Bush slanders  and then people actually got to art.
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.
So that started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later,  after a bunch of organization  and a bunch of moving things around,  we'd accomplished a couple things.
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,  and we actually got TEMPT a machine  that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.
Which was awesome.
And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,  because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,  and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."
The other thing we did  is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --  literally every corner of the world --  into our house.
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,  and these hackers and programmers  and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that  and that we were going to come back  and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.
But for over two weeks,  we programmed,  we went to the Venice boardwalk,  my kids got involved,  my dog got involved,  and we created this.
This is called the EyeWriter,  and you can see the description.
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses  that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,  some copper wire  and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,  mounted it to an LED light,  and now there's a device that is free --  you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,  you download the software for free.
And now we've created a device  that has absolutely no limitations.
There's no insurance company that can say "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access  to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks,  we went back to TEMPT's room.
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room  and that's his room.
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.
And after over a year of planning,  two weeks of programming,  carb-fest and all-night sessions,  Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.
And this is an amazing picture,  because this is his life support system,  and he's looking over his life support system.
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.
And we set up a projector  on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.
And he drew again for the first time,  in front of his family and friends --  and you can only imagine  what the feeling in the parking lot was.
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,  so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.
So at the end of this, he sent us an email,  and this is what the email said:  "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.
I feel like I had been held underwater,  and someone finally reached down  and pulled my head up so I could breathe."
Isn't that awesome?
So that's kind of our battle cry.
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.
And we've got such a long way to go with this.
This is an amazing device,  but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.
So we're in the process of trying to figure out  how to make it better, faster, stronger.
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.
We've won a bunch of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.
It's all coming out of our own pockets.
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."
Armstrong Twittered about us,  and then in December, Time magazine honored us  as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.
The coolest thing about this --  and this is what's completing the whole circle --  is that in April of this year,  at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,  there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets."
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have  pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene --  Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS --  all of these guys will be there.
TEMPT's going to be in the show,  which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my point:  If you see something that's not possible,  make it possible.
Everything in this room wasn't possible --  this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter --  wasn't possible at one point.
Make it possible, everyone in this room.
I'm not a programmer,  never done anything with ocular recognition technology,  but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people  so that we could make something happen.
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself  every single day  when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:  if not now, then when? And if not me, then who?
Thank you guys.
I have spent the past few years  putting myself into situations  that are usually very difficult  and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
I went to prison --  difficult.
I worked in a coal mine --  dangerous.
I filmed in war zones --  difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this --  fun in the beginning,  little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, most of my career,  I've been immersing myself  into seemingly horrible situations  for the whole goal of trying  to examine societal issues  in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,  that hopefully break them down in a way  that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
So when I knew I was coming here  to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,  I knew I would want to do something a little different.
So as some of you may or may not have heard,  a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.
I sent out some Facebook messages,  some Twitter messages,  and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights  to my 2011 TED Talk.
So what you were getting was this:  Your name here presents:  My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is  and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,  especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
But that being said,  it's a very good media opportunity.
You know how many people watch these TED Talks?
It's a lot.
That's just a working title, by the way.
So even with that caveat,  I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,  I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,  we examine the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said earlier,  I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,  but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,  for anything as difficult  or as dangerous  as going into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film  all about product placement, marketing and advertising,  where the entire film is funded  by product placement, marketing and advertising.
So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"  is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,  is branded from beginning to end --  from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,  which is brand X.
Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,  the Staples Center ...
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea -- (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)  It's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?
I'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)  That was more for emphasis.
It was, "In perpetuity. Forever."
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,  but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"  the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is,  beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,  but actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)  MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.
The goal of this whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.
So that's the whole concept,  the whole film, start to finish.
And I would love for CEG to help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know it's funny,  because when I first hear it,  it is the ultimate respect  for an audience.
Guy: I don't know how receptive  people are going to be to it, though.
XK: Do you have a perspective --  I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation --  but do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)  David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?
MS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)  John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,  but I think it's certainly worth pursuing  a couple big, really obvious brands.
XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,  we look like a bunch of blithering idiots.
MS: What do you think the response is going to be?
Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film  or a tough sell because of me?
JK: Both.
MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.
So, sir, can you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help you.
MS: Okay. (MK: Good.)  Awesome.
MK: We've gotta figure out which brands.
MS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)  When you look at the people you deal with ..
MK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)  Turn the camera off.
MS: I thought "Turn the camera off"  meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation."
Turns out it really means,  "We want nothing to do with your movie."
MS: And just like that, one by one,  all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.
I was amazed.
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,  was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,  to get as many people to see it as possible.
Especially in today's world,  this intersection of new media and old media  and the fractured media landscape,  isn't the idea to get  that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle  that's going to get that message to the masses?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see,  my idea had one fatal flaw,  and that flaw was this.
Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.
That wouldn't have been a problem at all.
This would have been fine.
But what this image represents was the problem.
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency,  this is ---      This is one of the first images that comes up.
So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.
This is was the problem: transparency --  free from pretense or deceit;  easily detected or seen through;  readily understood;  characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,  especially concerning business practices --  that last line being probably the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
Our politicians say it, our president says it,  even our CEO's say it.
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,  something suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency is scary --    like that odd, still-screaming bear.
It's unpredictable --      like this odd country road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is risky?
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.
That's very risky.
Now when I started talking to companies  and telling them that we wanted to tell this story,  and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story,  but we just want to tell our story."
See, when I was a kid  and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie --  and there he is giving me the look he often gave me --  he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.
There's your story,  there's my story  and there's the real story."
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me --  and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years --  I realized that I would have to go on my own,  I'd have to cut out the middleman  and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
So what you suddenly started to realize --  or what I started to realize --  is that when you started having conversations with these companies,  the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,  and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies  say the reason their films are so successful  is because of the brand partners that they have.
And then my friends who make small independent films  say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete  with these big, giant Hollywood movies?"
And the movie is called  "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,  you will see Ban deodorant.
While anytime I do an interview with someone,  I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?
Are you ready? You look a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
So maybe you should put some one before the interview."
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"  they'll have their chance.
We will have them geared for both male or female --  solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.
That's the two-cent tour.
So now I can answer any of your questions  and give you the five-cent tour.
Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand.
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie,  we're very much a challenger brand.
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.
So doing things like this -- you know,  remind people about Ban --  is kind of why were interested in it.
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?
Ban is blank.
KF: That's a great question.
Woman: Superior technology.
MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something  somebody's putting in their armpit.
Man: We talk about bold, fresh.
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,  versus "fights odor and wetness."
It keeps you fresh.
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness,  more freshness, three times fresher.
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.
MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.
What about me? What about a regular guy?
I need to go talk to the man on the street,  the people who are like me, the regular Joes.
They need to tell me about my brand.
MS: How would you guys describe your brand?
Man: Um, my brand?
I don't know.
I like really nice clothes.
Woman: 80's revival  meets skater-punk,  unless it's laundry day.
MS: All right, what is brand Gerry?
Gerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)  Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am  would be like dark glamor.
I like a lot of black colors,  a lot of grays and stuff like that.
But usually I have an accessory,  like sunglasses,  or I like crystal and things like that too.
Woman: If Dan were a brand,  he might be a classic convertible  Mercedes Benz.
Man 2: The brand that I am  is, I would call it casual fly.
Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,  part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my warped little industry, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.
Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.
Is that something?
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself  at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.
And what I realized is I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get inside my head,  somebody who could really help me understand  what they call your "brand personality."
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark  discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?
MS: I did. The very first picture  is a picture of my family.
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
A: Tell me about this world.
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in --  like people who are around you, your friends, your family,  the way you live your life, the job you do.
All those things stemmed and started from one place,  and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?
MS: It's like, who do I want to be?
I like things that are different.
I like things that are weird. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us?
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?
Tell me a little bit about that part.
... A little more about you that is not who you are.
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?
... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?
MS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)  A: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea  that you had two distinct, but complementary  sides to your brand personality --  the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.
And I think some companies  will just focus on one of their strengths or the other  instead of focusing on both.
Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature --  to avoid things that they're not sure of,  avoid fear, those elements,  and you really embrace those,  and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.
What other brands are like that?
The first on here is the classic, Apple.
And you can see here too, Target, Wii,  Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands,  those things that have come and gone,  but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,  what would you be?
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
Or are you more of a down attribute?
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?
Up attributes are things like being playful,  being fresh like the Fresh Prince,  contemporary, adventurous,  edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,  nimble or agile, profane, domineering,  magical or mystical like Gandalf.
Or are you more of a down attribute?
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,  empathetic like the Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, familiar,  safe, secure, sacred,  contemplative or wise  like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
Over the course of this film,  we had 500-plus companies  who were up and down companies  saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,  they would have no control over the final product.
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,  as we got into telling the story in this film  about how now they're using MRI's  to target the desire centers of your brain  for both commercials as well as movie marketing.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.
In the entire city for the past five years,  there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.
And we went to school districts  where now companies are making their way  into cash-strapped schools all across America.
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,  or I've had the most success in,  are ones where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies  and said, "Maybe these agencies  don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different,  something that's going to get people thinking,  that's going to challenge the way we look at the world."
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,  and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --  we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
That's only online -- no print, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
So ultimately,  this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to  advised their clients not to take part.
What I always believe  is that if you take chances, if you take risks,  that in those risks will come opportunity.
I believe that when you push people away from that,  you're pushing them more towards failure.
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,  then you're preparing your whole company  to be reward challenged.
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward  is we need to encourage people to take risks.
We need to encourage people to not be afraid  of opportunities that may scare them.
Ultimately, moving forward,  I think we have to embrace fear.
We've got to put that bear in a cage.
Embrace fear. Embrace risk.
One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.
Today, more than ever,  a little honesty is going to go a long way.
And that being said, through honesty and transparency,  my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"  has been brought to you  by my good friends at EMC,  who for $7,100  bought the naming rights on eBay.
EMC: Turning big data  into big opportunity  for organizations all over the world.
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."
Thank you very much, guys.
June Cohen: So, Morgan,  in the name of transparency,  what exactly happened to that $7,100?
MS: That is a fantastic question.
I have in my pocket a check  made out to the parent organization to the TED organization,  the Sapling Foundation --  a check for $7,100  to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm  is actually quite simple.
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons  is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
The gray boxes that you see,  these are real-time control systems.
Now if we manage to compromise these systems  that control drive speeds and valves,  we can actually cause a lot of problems  with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't run Windows software;  they are a completely different technology.
But if we manage  to place a good Windows virus  on a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business.
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.
So we start with a Windows dropper.
The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished.
That's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we found that out.
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out.
And then some very funny things happened.
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat.
Didn't make sense to me.
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack.
It's completely directed.
The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box  if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target.
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany.
So we better find out what the target is soon."
So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one.
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information.
They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack.
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.
So they know everything.
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science.
It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before.
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.
We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code.
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.
And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code.
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets.
So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove.
In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported.
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down  to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
So I told my assistant,  "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."
And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data.
And that worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control.
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see.
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.
What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  by looking very closely  at data and data structures.
So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it.
I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.
So that made sense, that was a match.
And it even got better.
These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code?
An almost identical structure.
So again, that was a real good match.
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.
These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor.
And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover.
Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles.
The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves.
So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is.
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.
So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet.
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off.
Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges.
Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data.
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.
That's cool, huh?
The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room.
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system.
We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough.
So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond.
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.
So this is where we need digital safety systems.
And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen.
Your plant can blow up.
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.
That's scary.
But it gets worse.
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.
Think about this:  this attack is generic.
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment.
So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory.
It is generic.
And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.
Just spread it as wide as possible.
And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.
That's the consequence  that we have to face.
So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East.
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.
So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments.
We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now.
Thanks.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
Ralph, it's been quite widely reported  that people assume that Mossad  is the main entity behind this.
Is that your opinion?
Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?
Yeah. Okay.
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,  but that the leading force is not Israel.
So the leading force behind that  is the cyber superpower.
There is only one,  and that's the United States --  fortunately, fortunately.
Because otherwise,  our problems would even be bigger.
CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.
I want you now to imagine  a wearable robot  that gives you superhuman abilities,  or another one that takes wheelchair users  up standing and walking again.
We at Berkeley Bionics  call these robots exoskeletons.
These are nothing else  than something that you put on in the morning,  and it will give you extra strength,  and it will further enhance your speed,  and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
It is actually the true integration  of the man and the machine.
But not only that --  it will integrate and network you  to the universe  and other devices out there.
This is just not some blue sky thinking.
To show you now what we are working on  by starting out talking about  the American soldier,  that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,  and they are being asked to carry more equipment.
Obviously, this is resulting  in some major complications --  back injuries, 30 percent of them --  chronic back injuries.
So we thought we would look at this challenge  and create an exoskeleton  that would help deal with this issue.
So let me now introduce to you HULC --  or the Human Universal  Load Carrier.
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,  I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain  for many hours.
Its flexible design allows for deep squats,  crawls and high-agility movements.
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,  and then augments my strength and endurance.
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner  to introduce this device,  this new exoskeleton this year.
So this is for real.
Now let's turn our heads  towards the wheelchair users,  something that I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people  estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.
This is about one percent of the total population.
And that's actually a conservative estimate.
We are talking here about, oftentimes,  very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,  that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --  hit a wall  and the wheelchair's the only option.
But it is also the aging population  that is multiplying in numbers.
And the only option, pretty much --  when it's stroke or other complications --  is the wheelchair.
And that is actually for the last 500 years,  since its very successful introduction, I must say.
So we thought we would start  writing a brand new chapter  of mobility.
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS  that is worn by Amanda Boxtel  that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,  and as a result of that  she has not been able to walk  for 19 years until now.
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.
It has sensors.
It's completely non-invasive,  sensors in the crutches  that send signals back to our onboard computer  that is sitting here at her back.
There are battery packs here as well  that power motors that are sitting at her hips,  as well as her knee joints,  that move her forward  in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.
AB: I was 24 years old  and at the top of my game  when a freak summersault while downhill skiing  paralyzed me.
In a split second,  I lost all sensation and movement  below my pelvis.
Not long afterwards,  a doctor strode into my hospital room,  and he said, "Amanda,  you'll never walk again."
And that was 19 yeas ago.
He robbed  every ounce of hope  from my being.
Adaptive technology  has since enabled me  to learn how to downhill ski again,  to rock climb and even handcycle.
But nothing has been invented  that enables me to walk,  until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see,  we have the technology,  we have the platforms  to sit down and have discussions with you.
It's in our hands,  and we have all the potential here  to change the lives  of future generations --  not only for the soldiers,  or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,  but for everyone.
AB: Thanks.
I just came back from a community  that holds the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women run the show,  have sex to say hello,  and play rules the day --  where fun is serious business.
And no, this isn't Burning Man  or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos  in the jungles of Congo.
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,  your living closest relative.
That means we all share a common ancestor,  an evolutionary grandmother,  who lived around six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are well-known  for their aggression.
But unfortunately,  we have made too much of an emphasis  of this aspect  in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us  the other side of the coin.
While chimpanzees  are dominated by big, scary guys,  bonobo society  is run by empowered females.
These guys have really worked something out,  since this leads to a highly tolerant society  where fatal violence  has not been observed yet.
But unfortunately,  bonobos are the least understood  of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,  and it has been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox --  a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,  but also the heart of darkness itself --  the scene of a violent conflict  that has raged for decades  and claimed nearly as many lives  as the First World War.
Not surprisingly,  this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
Bushmeat trades and forest loss  means we couldn't fill a small stadium  with all the bonobos that are left in the world --  and we're not even sure of that to be honest.
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,  you can hear hidden laughter  swaying the trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes  since they have frequent, promiscuous  and bisexual sex  to manage conflict  and solve social issues.
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution  to all of humanity's problems --  since there's more to bonobo life  than the Kama Sutra.
Bonobos, like humans,  love to play throughout their entire lives.
Play is not just child's games.
For us and them,  play is foundational for bonding relationships  and fostering tolerance.
It's where we learn to trust  and where we learn about the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity  and resilience,  and it's all about the generation of diversity --  diversity of interactions,  diversity of behaviors,  diversity of connections.
And when you watch bonobo play,  you're seeing the very evolutionary roots  of human laughter, dance  and ritual.
Play is the glue  that binds us together.
Now, I don't know how you play,  but I want to show you a couple of unique clips  fresh from the wild.
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --  and I do not mean football.
So here,  we have a young female and a male  engaged in a chase game.
Have a look what she's doing.
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,  "she's got him by the balls."
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
Yeah.
So sex play is common  in both bonobos and humans.
And this video is really interesting  because it shows --  this video's really interesting  because it shows the inventiveness  of bringing unusual elements into play --  such as testicles --  and also how play both requires trust  and fosters trust --  while at the same time being tremendous fun.
But play's a shapeshifter.
Play's a shapeshifter,  and it can take many forms,  some of which are more quiet,  imaginative, curious --  maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
And I want you to see,  this is Fuku, a young female,  and she is quietly playing with water.
I think, like her,  we sometimes play alone,  and we explore the boundaries  of our inner and our outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity  that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,  and then the unexpected connections we form  are the real hotbed for creativity.
So these are just small tasters  into the insights that bonobo give us  to our past and present.
But they also hold a secret for our future,  a future where we need to adapt  to an increasingly challenging world  through greater creativity  and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key  to these capacities.
In other words,  play is our adaptive wildcard.
In order to adapt successfully  to a changing world,  we need to play.
But will we make the most of our playfulness?
Play is not frivolous.
Play's essential.
For bonobos and humans alike,  life is not just red in tooth and claw.
In times when it seems least appropriate to play,  it might be the times when it is most urgent.
And so, my fellow primates,  let us embrace this gift from evolution  and play together,  as we rediscover creativity,  fellowship and wonder.
Thank you.
Back in New York, I am the head of development  for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires  as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
Now in our town,  where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,  you have to get to the fire scene pretty early  to get in on any action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the scene,  so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers  to get to the captain in charge  to find out what our assignments would be.
When I found the captain,  he was having a very engaging conversation  with the homeowner,  who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night,  she was standing outside in the pouring rain,  under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,  while her house was in flames.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --  let's call him Lex Luther --    got to the captain first  and was asked to go inside  and save the homeowner's dog.
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager  who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people  that he went into a burning building  to save a living creature,  just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
The captain waved me over.
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,  and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."
I swear.
So, not exactly what I was hoping for,  but off I went --  up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,  who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,  into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.
Now I know what you're thinking,  but I'm no hero.
I carried my payload back downstairs  where I met my nemesis  and the precious dog by the front door.
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,  where, not surprisingly,  his received much more attention than did mine.
A few weeks later,  the department received a letter from the homeowner  thanking us for the valiant effort displayed  in saving her home.
The act of kindness she noted above all others:  someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood  and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,  I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness  on a monumental scale,  but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage  on an individual basis.
And you know what I've learned?
They all matter.
So as I look around this room  at people who either have achieved,  or are on their way to achieving,  remarkable levels of success,  I would offer this reminder:  don't wait.
Don't wait until you make your first million  to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give,  give it now.
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.
Be a mentor.
Not every day is going to offer us a chance  to save somebody's life,  but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
So get in the game. Save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may sound strange,  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868  with a very simple idea:  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement  that fit together.
Very quickly concrete blocks became  the most-used construction unit in the world.
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,  buildings, bridges,  one brick at a time.
Essentially concrete blocks had become  the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,  LEGO came up with this.
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
And in a few short years,  LEGO bricks took place in every household.
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --  or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer  to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
LEGO made it accessible.
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,  and made it into the building block  of our imagination.
Meanwhile the exact same year,  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,  the next building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit  that would take us from a world  of static bricks piled on top of each other  to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block,  the transistor allows you to build  much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
But there's a main difference:  The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't accept this,  that the building block of our time  is reserved for experts,  so I decided to change that.
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,  I started exploring this idea  of how to put the power of engineers  in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
Let me show you how they work.
LittleBits are electronic modules  with each one specific function.
They're pre-engineered  to be light, sound,  motors and sensors.
And the best part about it  is they snap together with magnets.
So you can't put them the wrong way.
The bricks are color-coded.
Green is output, blue is power,  pink is input and orange is wire.
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green  and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
You put a blue to a green,  you can make light.
You can put a knob in between  and now you've made a little dimmer.
Switch out the knob  for a pulse module,  which is here,  and now you've made a little blinker.
Add this buzzer  for some extra punch  and you've created a noise machine.
I'm going to stop that.
So beyond simple play,  littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,  littleBits allow you to program  using very simple intuitive gestures.
So to make this blink faster or slower,  you would just turn this knob  and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littleBits  is that it's a growing library.
We want to make every single interaction in the world  into a ready-to-use brick.
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --  everything should be accessible.
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The nicest thing is how they start to understand  the electronics around them from everyday  that they don't learn at schools.
For example, how a nightlight works,  or why an elevator door stays open,  or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
So for example, we've had designers  with no experience with electronics whatsoever  start to play with littleBits as a material.
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,  we have Geordie making ...
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD  and gave them to some designers  with no experience in engineering whatsoever --  just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."
Here's an example of a project they made,  a motion-activated confetti canon ball.
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
It's a lobster made of playdough  that's afraid of the dark.
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,  electronics became just another material.
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
So littleBits is open-source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
We want to encourage a world  of creators, of inventors, of contributors,  because this world that we live in,  this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and start inventing.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk  about unexpected discoveries.
Now I work in the solar technology industry.
And my small startup  is looking to force ourselves  into the environment  by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.
It's just a quick video  of what we do.
Huh. Hang on a moment.
It might take a moment to load.
We'll just -- we can just skip --  I'll just skip through the video instead ...
No.
This is not ...
Okay.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, that's all my time?
Okay. Thank you very much.
So a couple of years ago I started a program  to try to get the rockstar tech and design people  to take a year off  and work in the one environment  that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;  we have them work in government.
The program is called Code for America,  and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
We select a few fellows every year  and we have them work with city governments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third World,  we send them into the wilds of City Hall.
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible  with technology today.
So meet Al.
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,  but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,  because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires  when he's covered in four feet of snow.
Now how did he come to be looking for help  in this very unique manner?
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year  through the Code for America program.
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets  to digging out these fire hydrants.
But one fellow in particular,  a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,  noticed something else,  and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks  right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do,  he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it,  and he called the first one Al.
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest  of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something  that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu  who saw this app and realized  that he could use it, not for snow,  but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,  but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it  to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
And Chicago just rolled it out  to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
So we now know of nine cities  that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just frictionlessly,  organically, naturally.
If you know anything about government technology,  you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year  that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out  which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,  it would have taken at least two years  and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now  that so far cost taxpayers  two billion dollars,  and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this  at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write  and then spreads virally,  that's sort of a shot across the bow  to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better --  not more like a private company,  as many people think it should.
And not even like a tech company,  but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless,  it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app  is that it represents how a new generation  is tackling the problem of government --  not as the problem of an ossified institution,  but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news,  because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action  with digital technology.
Now there's a very large community of people  that are building the tools that we need  to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows,  there are hundreds of people all over the country  that are standing and writing civic apps  every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it,  but they're not complaining about it,  they're fixing it.
And these folks know something  that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings  about politics and the line at the DMV  and all those other things  that we're really mad about,  government is, at its core,  in the words of Tim O'Reilly,  "What we do together that we can't do alone."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people,  I would ask that you reconsider,  because things are changing.
Politics is not changing;  government is changing.
And because government  ultimately derives its power from us --  remember "We the people?" --  how we think about it  is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people,  I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion  that, especially local government,  is about opossums.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get  if you call 311 in your city.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house  and play music really loud  and see if the thing leaves?"
So that worked. So booya for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an app, a Web and mobile app,  called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people  at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:  "Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this removed?"
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.
But on Citizens Connect everything is public,  so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said,  "I walked over to this location,  found the trashcan behind the house.
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.
Goodnight sweet opossum."
Pretty simple.
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
And it's also a great example  of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't mean necessarily  a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people  to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen,  but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,  but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative  to government services.
When one neighbor helps another,  we strengthen our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government  is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that,  but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government  is voting.
Now how many times have we elected a political leader --  and sometimes we spend a lot of energy  getting a new political leader elected --  and then we sit back and we expect government  to reflect our values and meet our needs,  and then not that much changes?
That's because government is like a vast ocean  and politics is the six-inch layer on top.
And what's under that  is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with such contempt.
But it's that contempt  that keeps this thing that we own  and we pay for  as something that's working against us, this other thing,  and then we're disempowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work for us,  we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
Have you seen these guys?
It's a group of concerned citizens  that have written a very detailed  325-page report  that's a response to the SEC's request for comment  on the Financial Reform Bill.
That's not being politically active,  that's being bureaucratically active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government,  it's time that we asked ourselves  about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges  that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go  without fixing the one institution  that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government,  but we do need it  to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible  to fundamentally reframe  the function of government  in a way that can actually scale  by strengthening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,  and they know that it's not that hard  to do things together,  you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fellows is 28,  so I am, begrudgingly,  almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation  that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting  about who gets to speak;  they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion  on any channel at any time,  and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government,  they don't care as much  about using their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands  to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands  to make our communities better.
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,  turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,  and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital reminders  that we're not just consumers,  and we're not just consumers of government,  putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that,  we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government  until we fix citizenship.
So the question I have for all of you here:  When it comes to the big, important things  that we need to do together,  all of us together,  are we just going to be a crowd of voices,  or are we also going to be  a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
I spend most of my time  in jails, in prisons, on death row.
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities  in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.
And being here at TED  and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,  has been very, very energizing to me.
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here  is that TED has an identity.
And you can actually say things here  that have impacts around the world.
And sometimes when it comes through TED,  it has meaning and power  that it doesn't have when it doesn't.
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.
And we've had some fantastic presentations.
And I think what we've learned  is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,  but if you're a compassionate teacher,  they can be especially meaningful.
If you're a doctor you can do some good things,  but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.
And I didn't learn about this actually  practicing law and doing the work that I do.
I actually learned about this from my grandmother.
I grew up in a house  that was the traditional African-American home  that was dominated by a matriarch,  and that matriarch was my grandmother.
She was tough, she was strong,  she was powerful.
She was the end of every argument in our family.
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.
She was born in the 1880's  and the experience of slavery  very much shaped the way she saw the world.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
When I would see her as a little boy,  she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe  and then she'd let me go.
And an hour or two later, if I saw her,  she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"
And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,  and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.
And she just had this quality  that you always wanted to be near her.
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,  it would be difficult to get her time and attention.
My cousins would be running around everywhere.
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,  waking up one morning, going into the living room,  and all of my cousins were running around.
And my grandmother was sitting across the room  staring at me.
And at first I thought we were playing a game.
And I would look at her and I'd smile,  but she was very serious.
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,  she got up and she came across the room  and she took me by the hand  and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.
I never will forget it.
She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,  but you don't tell anybody what I tell you."
I said, "Okay, Mama."
She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."
Then she sat me down and she looked at me  and she said, "I want you to know  I've been watching you."
And she said, "I think you're special."
She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."
I will never forget it.
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."
I said, "Okay, Mama."
She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me  is that you'll always love your mom."
She said, "That's my baby girl,  and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."
Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me  is that you'll always do the right thing  even when the right thing is the hard thing."
And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me  is that you'll never drink alcohol."
Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."
I grew up in the country in the rural South,  and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
When I was about 14 or 15,  one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer --  I don't know where he got it --  and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,  and they offered it to me.
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.
I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."
I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."
And then my brother started staring at me.
He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."
Then he looked at me real hard and he said,  "Oh, I hope you're not still hung up  on that conversation Mama had with you."
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"
He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."
I was devastated.
And I'm going to admit something to you.
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.
I know this might be broadcast broadly.
But I'm 52 years old,  and I'm going to admit to you  that I've never had a drop of alcohol.
I don't say that because I think that's virtuous;  I say that because there is power in identity.
When we create the right kind of identity,  we can say things to the world around us  that they don't actually believe makes sense.
We can get them to do things  that they don't think they can do.
When I thought about my grandmother,  of course she would think all her grandkids were special.
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.
Well I've been trying to say something  about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today  than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.
Today, there are 2.3 million.
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration  in the world.
We have seven million people on probation and parole.
And mass incarceration, in my judgment,  has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, in communities of color  there is this despair,  there is this hopelessness,  that is being shaped by these outcomes.
One out of three black men  between the ages of 18 and 30  is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.
In urban communities across this country --  Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington --  50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are  in jail or prison or on probation or parole.
Our system isn't just being shaped  in these ways that seem to be distorting around race,  they're also distorted by poverty.
We have a system of justice in this country  that treats you much better  if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
Wealth, not culpability,  shapes outcomes.
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.
The politics of fear and anger  have made us believe  that these are problems that are not our problems.
We've been disconnected.
It's interesting to me.
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.
My state of Alabama, like a number of states,  actually permanently disenfranchises you  if you have a criminal conviction.
Right now in Alabama  34 percent of the black male population  has permanently lost the right to vote.
We're actually projecting in another 10 years  the level of disenfranchisement  will be as high as it's been  since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
And there is this stunning silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world  where we sentence 13-year-old children  to die in prison.
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.
And we're actually doing some litigation.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on death row.
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty.
In many ways, we've been taught to think  that the real question is,  do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?
And that's a very sensible question.
But there's another way of thinking  about where we are in our identity.
The other way of thinking about it  is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,  but do we deserve to kill?
I mean, it's fascinating.
Death penalty in America is defined by error.
For every nine people who have been executed,  we've actually identified one innocent person  who's been exonerated and released from death row.
A kind of astonishing error rate --  one out of nine people innocent.
I mean, it's fascinating.
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes  if for every nine planes that took off  one would crash.
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these issues.
I talk about race and this question  of whether we deserve to kill.
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,  I tell them about slavery.
I tell them about terrorism,  the era that began at the end of reconstruction  that went on to World War II.
We don't really know very much about it.
But for African-Americans in this country,  that was an era defined by terror.
In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.
They had to worry about being bombed.
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.
And these older people come up to me now  and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,  you tell people to stop saying  we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history  after 9/11."
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."
And that era of terrorism, of course,  was followed by segregation  and decades of racial subordination  and apartheid.
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic  where we really don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And because of that, we really haven't understood  what it's meant to do the things we've done historically.
We're constantly running into each other.
We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.
We have a hard time talking about race,  and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves  to a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood  that we couldn't overcome apartheid  without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,  but in this country we haven't done that.
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.
It was fascinating  because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation  and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling  to hear what you're talking about."
He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."
And the room got very quiet,  and this woman said,  "There's no way, with our history,  we could ever engage  in the systematic killing of human beings.
It would be unconscionable for us  to, in an intentional and deliberate way,  set about executing people."
And I thought about that.
What would it feel like  to be living in a world  where the nation state of Germany was executing people,  especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?
I couldn't bear it.
It would be unconscionable.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.
That when we actually don't care  about these difficult things,  the positive and wonderful things  are nonetheless implicated.
We love innovation.
We love technology. We love creativity.
We love entertainment.
But ultimately,  those realities  are shadowed by suffering,  abuse, degradation,  marginalization.
And for me, it becomes necessary  to integrate the two.
Because ultimately we are talking  about a need to be more hopeful,  more committed, more dedicated  to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.
And for me that means  spending time thinking and talking  about the poor, the disadvantaged,  those who will never get to TED.
But thinking about them in a way  that is integrated in our own lives.
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.
We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.
Innovation, creativity,  development comes  not from the ideas in our mind alone.
They come from the ideas in our mind  that are also fueled  by some conviction in our heart.
And it's that mind-heart connection  that I believe compels us  to not just be attentive  to all the bright and dazzly things,  but also the dark and difficult things.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,  we wanted all kinds of things,  but mostly what we needed was hope,  an orientation of the spirit,  a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places  and be a witness."
Well that orientation of the spirit  is very much at the core of what I believe  even TED communities  have to be engaged in.
There is no disconnect  around technology and design  that will allow us to be fully human  until we pay attention to suffering,  to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.
Now I will warn you  that this kind of identity  is a much more challenging identity  than ones that don't pay attention to this.
It will get to you.
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
And these women would get together and just talk.
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,  and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.
Do you want to come over and listen?"
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."
And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"
I said, "I'm going to listen."
And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.
It would be so energizing and so empowering.
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,  and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me  and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I began giving her my rap.
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.
We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination  in the administration of criminal justice.
We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.
We're trying to do something about the death penalty.
We're trying to reduce the prison population.
We're trying to end mass incarceration."
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me  and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."
She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."
And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,  she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
And I actually believe that the TED community  needs to be more courageous.
We need to find ways  to embrace these challenges,  these problems, the suffering.
Because ultimately, our humanity depends  on everyone's humanity.
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
It's just taught me very simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe  that each of us  is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
I believe that for every person on the planet.
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,  they're not just a thief.
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.
And because of that there's this basic human dignity  that must be respected by law.
I also believe  that in many parts of this country,  and certainly in many parts of this globe,  that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
I don't believe that.
I actually think, in too many places,  the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe  that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic  and so beautiful and so inspiring  and so stimulating,  we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,  we won't be judged by our design,  we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,  not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,  but by how they treat the poor,  the condemned, the incarcerated.
Because it's in that nexus  that we actually begin to understand truly profound things  about who we are.
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.
I sometimes push too hard.
I do get tired, as we all do.
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking  in ways that are important.
And I've been representing these kids  who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,  and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?
How can a judge turn you into something  that you're not?
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,  well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,  the judge must have magic power.
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.
You should ask for some of that.
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,  I started working on a motion.
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
And I started working on this motion,  and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,  14-year-old black male client  like a privileged, white 75-year-old  corporate executive."
And I put in my motion  that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,  it's all misconduct.
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,  or did I actually write it?
And to my horror, not only had I written it,  but I had sent it to court.
A couple months went by,  and I had just forgotten all about it.
And I finally decided,  oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
And I got into my car  and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,  there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
When this man saw me, he came over to me  and he said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."
And this man came over to me  and he hugged me.
And he whispered in my ear.
He said, "I'm so proud of you."
And I have to tell you,  it was energizing.
It connected deeply with something in me  about identity,  about the capacity of every person to contribute  to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.
Well I went into the courtroom.
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.
And people started coming in because they were just outraged.
I had written these crazy things.
And police officers were coming in  and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people  angry that we were talking about race,  that we were talking about poverty,  that we were talking about inequality.
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.
He kept pacing back and forth.
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face  came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,  almost at counsel table.
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended  that the janitor had come into court.
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"
And this older black man stood up  and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me  and he said, "I came into this courtroom  to tell this young man,  keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
I've come to TED  because I believe that many of you understand  that the moral arc of the universe is long,  but it bends toward justice.
That we cannot be full evolved human beings  until we care about human rights and basic dignity.
That all of our survival  is tied to the survival of everyone.
That our visions of technology and design  and entertainment and creativity  have to be married with visions  of humanity, compassion and justice.
And more than anything,  for those of you who share that,  I've simply come to tell you  to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw  an obvious desire by this audience, this community,  to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.
Other than writing a check,  what could we do?
BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.
If you live in the state of California, for example,  there's a referendum coming up this spring  where actually there's going to be an effort  to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
For example, here in California  we're going to spend one billion dollars  on the death penalty in the next five years --  one billion dollars.
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases  don't result in arrest.
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.
So there's an opportunity to change that.
And this referendum would propose having those dollars  go to law enforcement and safety.
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.
CA: There's been this huge decline  in crime in America over the last three decades.
And part of the narrative of that  is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.
What would you say to someone who believed that?
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate  has remained relatively stable.
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country  wasn't really in violent crime categories.
It was this misguided war on drugs.
That's where the dramatic increases have come  in our prison population.
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
And so we have three strikes laws  that put people in prison forever  for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,  rather than making them give those resources back  to the people who they victimized.
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,  not do less.
And I think our current punishment philosophy  does nothing for no one.
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.
CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.
You're an inspiring person.
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips  I collected over the last six months --  could have easily been the last six days  or the last six years.
The point is that the news media  preferentially feeds us negative stories  because that's what our minds pay attention to.
And there's a very good reason for that.
Every second of every day,  our senses bring in way too much data  than we can possibly process in our brains.
And because nothing is more important to us  than survival,  the first stop of all of that data  is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe  called the amygdala.
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector,  our danger detector.
It sorts and scours through all of the information  looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.
So given a dozen news stories,  we will preferentially look  at the negative news.
And that old newspaper saying,  "If it bleeds it leads,"  is very true.
So given all of our digital devices  that are bringing all the negative news to us  seven days a week, 24 hours a day,  it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.
It's no wonder that people think  that the world is getting worse.
But perhaps that's not the case.
Perhaps instead,  it's the distortions brought to us  of what's really going on.
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made  over the last century  by a series of forces  are, in fact, accelerating to a point  that we have the potential in the next three decades  to create a world of abundance.
Now I'm not saying  we don't have our set of problems --  climate crisis, species extinction,  water and energy shortage -- we surely do.
And as humans, we are far better  at seeing the problems way in advance,  but ultimately we knock them down.
So let's look  at what this last century has been  to see where we're going.
Over the last hundred years,  the average human lifespan has more than doubled,  average per capita income adjusted for inflation  around the world has tripled.
Childhood mortality  has come down a factor of 10.
Add to that the cost of food, electricity,  transportation, communication  have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.
Steve Pinker has showed us  that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever  in human history.
And Charles Kenny  that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent  in the last 130 years.
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.
Think of this, in America today,  the majority of people under the poverty line  still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,  television, mobile phones,  air conditioning and cars.
The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,  could have never dreamed of such luxuries.
Underpinning much of this  is technology,  and of late,  exponentially growing technologies.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil  showed that any tool that becomes an information technology  jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,  and experiences price performance doubling  every 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cellphone in your pocket  is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster  than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things from this curve.
Number one, how smooth it is --  through good time and bad time, war time and peace time,  recession, depression and boom time.
This is the result of faster computers  being used to build faster computers.
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
And also, even though it's plotted  on a log curve on the left,  it's curving upwards.
The rate at which the technology is getting faster  is itself getting faster.
And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,  are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies  available to all of us.
Cloud computing,  what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;  sensors and networks; robotics;  3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute  personalized production around the planet;  synthetic biology;  fuels, vaccines and foods;  digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy  by IBM's Watson?
I mean, that was epic.
In fact, I scoured the headlines  looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."
Jeopardy's not an easy game.
It's about the nuance of human language.
And imagine if you would  A.I.'s like this on the cloud  available to every person with a cellphone.
Four years ago here at TED,  Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university  called Singularity University.
And we teach our students all of these technologies,  and particularly how they can be used  to solve humanity's grand challenges.
And every year we ask them  to start a company or a product or a service  that can affect positively the lives of a billion people  within a decade.
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students  can touch the lives of a billion people today.
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.
Today we can point at dozens of companies  that have done just that.
When I think about creating abundance,  it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;  it's about creating a life of possibility.
It is about taking that which was scarce  and making it abundant.
You see, scarcity is contextual,  and technology is a resource-liberating force.
Let me give you an example.
So this is a story of Napoleon III  in the mid-1800s.
He's the dude on the left.
He invited over to dinner  the king of Siam.
All of Napoleon's troops  were fed with silver utensils,  Napoleon himself with gold utensils.
But the King of Siam,  he was fed with aluminum utensils.
You see, aluminum  was the most valuable metal on the planet,  worth more than gold and platinum.
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument  is made of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum  is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,  it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.
But then the technology of electrolysis came along  and literally made aluminum so cheap  that we use it with throw-away mentality.
So let's project this analogy going forward.
We think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen,  we are on a planet  that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy  than we use in a year.
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface  every 88 minutes.
It's not about being scarce,  it's about accessibility.
And there's good news here.
For the first time, this year  the cost of solar-generated electricity  is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India --  8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT put out a study  showing that by the end of this decade,  in the sunny parts of the United States,  solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour  compared to 15 cents  as a national average.
And if we have abundant energy,  we also have abundant water.
Now we talk about water wars.
Do you remember  when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft  back towards the Earth,  in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
He took a famous photo. What was it called?
"A Pale Blue Dot."
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.
Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,  two percent is ice,  and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,  but here too there is hope.
And there is technology coming online,  not 10, 20 years from now,  right now.
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,  one of the great DIY innovators,  I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so --  his technology called Slingshot  that many of you may have heard of,  it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
It's able to generate  a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day  out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine --  at less than two cents a liter.
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed  to do a major test  of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.
And if that pans out,  which I have every confidence it will,  Coca-Cola will deploy this globally  to 206 countries  around the planet.
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,  that exists today.
And we've seen this in cellphones.
My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration  of cellphones in the developing world  by the end of 2013.
Think about it,  that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya  has better mobile comm  than President Reagan did 25 years ago.
And if they're on a smartphone on Google,  they've got access to more knowledge and information  than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance  that no one could have ever predicted.
Better than that,  the things that you and I  spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for --  GPS, HD video and still images,  libraries of books and music,  medical diagnostic technology --  are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing  into your cellphone.
Probably the best part of it  is what's coming down the pike in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation  something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.
We're challenging teams around the world  to basically combine these technologies  into a mobile device  that you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,  you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better  than a team of board-certified doctors.
So literally, imagine this device  in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors,  25 percent of the disease burden  and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus  that it doesn't recognize,  it calls the CDC  and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
But here, here is the biggest force  for bringing about a world of abundance.
I call it the rising billion.
So the white lines here are population.
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.
And by the way,  the biggest protection against a population explosion  is making the world educated  and healthy.
In 2010,  we had just short of two billion people  online, connected.
By 2020,  that's going from two billion to five billion  Internet users.
Three billion new minds  who have never been heard from before  are connecting to the global conversation.
What will these people want?
What will they consume? What will they desire?
And rather than having economic shutdown,  we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.
These people represent  tens of trillions of dollars  injected into the global economy.
And they will get healthier  by using the Tricorder,  and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,  and by literally being able to use  3D printing and infinite computing  [become] more productive than ever before.
So what could three billion rising,  healthy, educated, productive members of humanity  bring to us?
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.
What about giving the oppressed,  wherever they might be,  the voice to be heard and the voice to act  for the first time ever?
What will these three billion people bring?
What about contributions we can't even predict?
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize  is that small teams  driven by their passion with a clear focus  can do extraordinary things,  things that large corporations and governments  could only do in the past.
Let me share and close with a story  that really got me excited.
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.
It's a game called Foldit.
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
And this is a game  where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids  and figure out how the protein is going to fold.
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.
And it's very important for research in medicine.
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.
And this game has been played  by university professors and so forth.
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people  came online and started playing it.
And it showed that, in fact, today,  the human pattern recognition machinery  is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen,  what gives me tremendous confidence  in the future  is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals  to take on the grand challenges of this planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the DIY innovator.
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.
And we have three billion new minds  coming online to work with us  to solve the grand challenges,  to do that which we must do.
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.
Thank you.
I'm going to speak  about a tiny, little idea.
And this is about shifting baseline.
And because the idea can be explained in one minute,  I will tell you three stories before  to fill in the time.
And the first story  is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
And he was here, as you well know, in '35.
And you'd think he was chasing finches,  but he wasn't.
He was actually collecting fish.
And he described one of them  as very "common."
This was the sailfin grouper.
A big fishery was run on it  until the '80s.
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
Now this story,  we have heard it lots of times  on Galapagos and other places,  so there is nothing particular about it.
But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.
We still think it is pristine.
The brochures still say  it is untouched.
So what happens here?
The second story, also to illustrate another concept,  is called shifting waistline.
Because I was there in '71,  studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe  and I wanted later to work in Africa.
And I thought I could blend in.
And I got a big sunburn,  and I was convinced that I was really not from there.
This was my first sunburn.
And the lagoon  was surrounded by palm trees,  as you can see, and a few mangrove.
And it had tilapia  about 20 centimeters,  a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.
And the fisheries for this tilapia  sustained lots of fish and they had a good time  and they earned more than average  in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later,  the fish had shrunk to half of their size.
They were maturing at five centimeters.
They had been pushed genetically.
There were still fishes.
They were still kind of happy.
And the fish also were happy to be there.
So nothing has changed,  but everything has changed.
My third little story  is that I was an accomplice  in the introduction of trawling  in Southeast Asia.
In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --  Europe did lots of development projects.
Fish development  meant imposing on countries  that had already 100,000 fishers  to impose on them industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly,  is called the Mutiara 4.
And I went sailing on it,  and we did surveys  throughout the southern South China sea  and especially the Java Sea.
And what we caught,  we didn't have words for it.
What we caught, I know now,  is the bottom of the sea.
And 90 percent of our catch  were sponges,  other animals that are fixed on the bottom.
And actually most of the fish,  they are a little spot on the debris,  the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.
Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck  and then was thrown down.
And these pictures are extraordinary  because this transition is very rapid.
Within a year, you do a survey  and then commercial fishing begins.
The bottom is transformed  from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral  into a muddy mess.
This is a dead turtle.
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.
And one time we caught a live one.
It was not drowned yet.
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.
This mountain of debris  is actually collected by fishers  every time they go  into an area that's never been fished.
But it's not documented.
We transform the world,  but we don't remember it.
We adjust our baseline  to the new level,  and we don't recall what was there.
If you generalize this,  something like this happens.
You have on the y axis some good thing:  biodiversity, numbers of orca,  the greenness of your country, the water supply.
And over time it changes --  it changes  because people do things, or naturally.
Every generation  will use the images  that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives  as a standard  and will extrapolate forward.
And the difference then,  they perceive as a loss.
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.
You can have a succession of changes.
At the end you want to sustain  miserable leftovers.
And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.
We want to sustain things that are gone  or things that are not the way they were.
Now one should think  this problem affected people  certainly when in predatory societies,  they killed animals  and they didn't know they had done so  after a few generations.
Because, obviously,  an animal that is very abundant,  before it gets extinct,  it becomes rare.
So you don't lose abundant animals.
You always lose rare animals.
And therefore they're not perceived  as a big loss.
Over time,  we concentrate on large animals,  and in a sea that means the big fish.
They become rarer because we fish them.
Over time we have a few fish left  and we think this is the baseline.
And the question is,  why do people accept this?
Well because they don't know that it was different.
And in fact, lots of people, scientists,  will contest that it was really different.
And they will contest this  because the evidence  presented in an earlier mode  is not in the way  they would like the evidence presented.
For example,  the anecdote that some present,  as Captain so-and-so  observed lots of fish in this area  cannot be used  or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,  because it's not "scientific."
So you have a situation  where people don't know the past,  even though we live in literate societies,  because they don't trust  the sources of the past.
And hence, the enormous role  that a marine protected area can play.
Because with marine protected areas,  we actually recreate the past.
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive  because the baseline has shifted  and is extremely low.
That is for people  who can see a marine protected area  and who can benefit  from the insight that it provides,  which enables them to reset their baseline.
How about the people who can't do that  because they have no access --  the people in the Midwest for example?
There I think  that the arts and film  can perhaps fill the gap,  and simulation.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --  500 years ago.
And you will have noticed that the hues and tones  are like "Avatar."
And if you think about "Avatar,"  if you think of why people were so touched by it --  never mind the Pocahontas story --  why so touched by the imagery?
Because it evokes something  that in a sense has been lost.
And so my recommendation,  it's the only one I will provide,  is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,  and I professionally watch YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral  and then why that even matters.
We all want to be stars --  celebrities, singers, comedians --  and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
But now Web video has made it  so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do  can become completely famous  in a part of our world's culture.
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet  by next Saturday.
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube  every minute.
And of that, only a tiny percentage  ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
So how does it happen?
Three things:  tastemakers, communities of participation  and unexpectedness.
All right, let's go.
Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wooo!
Ohhhhh, wowwww!
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video  that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
This is a chart of what it looked like  when it first became popular last summer.
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.
He just wanted to share a rainbow.
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
And this video had actually been posted  all the way back in January.
So what happened here?
Jimmy Kimmel actually.
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet  that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel  introduce us to new and interesting things  and bring them to a larger audience.
Rebecca Black:  It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday.    Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend.    Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday.   KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation  without talking about this video I hope.
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
This is a chart of what it looked like.
And similar to "Double Rainbow,"  it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Friday, this is true.
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.
But what about this day,  this one particular Friday?
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater  was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers  took a point of view  and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
And so then this community formed  of people who shared this big inside joke  and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days,  there was one parody for every other day of the week.
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,  this community participation  is how we become a part of the phenomenon --  either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation  with looped music.
It's this, just like this.
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
And if you think that that is weird,  you should know that there is a three-hour version of this  that's been viewed four million times.
Even cats were watching this video.
Cats were watching other cats watch this video.
But what's important here  is the creativity that it inspired  amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.
There were remixes.
Someone made an old timey version.
And then it went international.
An entire remix community sprouted up  that brought it from being just a stupid joke  to something that we can all actually be a part of.
Because we don't just enjoy now,  we participate.
And who could have predicted any of this?
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black  or "Nyan Cat?"
What scripts could you have written  that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video  get uploaded every minute,  only that which is truly unique and unexpected  can stand out in the way that these things have.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video  about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,  I admit I wasn't very interested.
Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,  but often there are obstructions  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,  Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point  seen five million times.
And so this approach holds  for anything new that we do creatively.
And so it all brings us  to one big question ...
Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?
Ohhhh.
KA: What does it mean?
Tastemakers, creative participating communities,  complete unexpectedness,  these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture  where anyone has access  and the audience defines the popularity.
I mean, as mentioned earlier,  one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,  got his start on YouTube.
No one has to green-light your idea.
And we all now feel some ownership  in our own pop culture.
And these are not characteristics of old media,  and they're barely true of the media of today,  but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece:  a man burning his life's work.
He is a poet, a playwright,  a man whose whole life  had been balanced on the single hope  of his country's unity and freedom.
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon,  confronting the fact  that his life had been a complete waste.
Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.
He retreated into silence.
He died broken by history.
He is my grandfather.
I never knew him in real life.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,  and my lesson was to learn  that, yes, history tried to crush us,  but we endured.
The next piece of the jigsaw  is of a boat in the early dawn  slipping silently out to sea.
My mother, Mai, was 18  when her father died --  already in an arranged marriage,  already with two small girls.
For her, life had distilled itself into one task:  the escape of her family  and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable to her  that she would not succeed.
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction,  a boat slipped out to sea  disguised as a fishing vessel.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was of pirates,  rape and death.
Like most adults on the boat,  my mother carried a small bottle of poison.
If we were captured, first my sister and I,  then she and my grandmother would drink.
My first memories are from the boat --  the steady beat of the engine,  the bow dipping into each wave,  the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came many times,  but were bluffed by the bravado  of the men on our boat,  or the engine dying  and failing to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig  off the Malaysian coast  and the young man who collapsed and died,  the journey's end too much for him,  and the first apple I tasted,  given to me by the men on the rig.
No apple has ever tasted the same.
After three months in a refugee camp,  we landed in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the jigsaw  is about four women across three generations  shaping a new life together.
We settled in Footscray,  a working-class suburb  whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,  whose existence I was oblivious of,  there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
And the snippets of halting English  were exchanged between people  who had one thing in common,  they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms,  then on a car assembly line,  working six days, double shifts.
Somehow she found time to study English  and gain IT qualifications.
We were poor.
All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics  was budgeted for  regardless of what missed out,  which was usually new clothes;  they were always secondhand.
Two pairs of stockings for school,  each to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform down to the ankles,  because it had to last for six years.
And there were rare but searing chants  of "slit-eye"  and the occasional graffiti:  "Asian, go home."
Go home to where?
Something stiffened inside me.
There was a gathering of resolve  and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you."
My mother, my sister and I  slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted each night,  but we told one another about our day  and listened to the movements  of my grandmother around the house.
My mother suffered from nightmares  all about the boat.
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came  so I could wake her.
She opened a computer store  then studied to be a beautician  and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories  about men who could not make the transition,  angry and inflexible,  and troubled children caught between two worlds.
Grants and sponsors were sought.
Centers were established.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic Asian student,  relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,  tragically scarred by violence,  drug abuse and isolation.
But so many over the years were helped.
And for that work, when I was a final year law student,  I was chosen as the young Australian of the year.
And I was catapulted  from one piece of the jigsaw to another,  and their edges didn't fit.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,  was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist,  invited to speak in venues she had never heard of  and into homes whose existence  she could never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort  of life in an unsung suburb --  a grandmother, a mother and two daughters  ending each day as they had for almost 20 years,  telling one another the story of their day  and falling asleep,  the three of us still in the same bed.
I told my mother I couldn't do it.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been  when we boarded the boat.
No had never been an option.
"Just do it," she said,  "and don't be what you're not."
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education  and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised.
And the more candidly I spoke,  the more I was asked to speak.
I met people from all walks of life,  so many of them doing the thing they loved,  living on the frontiers of possibility.
And even though I finished my degree,  I realized I could not settle into a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.
And I realized at the same time  that it is okay to be an outsider,  a recent arrival,  new on the scene --  and not just okay,  but something to be thankful for,  perhaps a gift from the boat.
Because being an insider  can so easily mean collapsing the horizons,  can so easily mean  accepting the presumptions of your province.
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now  to know that, yes, the world does fall apart,  but not in the way that you fear.
Possibilities that would not have been allowed  were outrageously encouraged.
There was an energy there,  an implacable optimism,  a strange mixture of humility and daring.
So I followed my hunches.
I gathered around me a small team of people  for whom the label "It can't be done"  was an irresistible challenge.
For a year we were penniless.
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup  which we all shared.
We worked well into each night.
Most of our ideas were crazy,  but a few were brilliant,  and we broke through.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip.
My hunches again.
Three months later I had relocated,  and the adventure has continued.
Before I close though,  let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time  when Confucianism was the social norm  and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died soon after she was born.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17 she became the second wife  of a Mandarin whose mother beat her.
With no support from her husband,  she caused a sensation by taking him to court  and prosecuting her own case,  and a far greater sensation when she won.
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney  the moment she died  600 miles away in Melbourne.
I looked through the shower screen  and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
My mother phoned minutes later.
A few days later,  we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray  and sat around her casket.
We told her stories  and assured her that we were still with her.
At midnight the monk came  and told us he had to close the casket.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk,  "Why is it that her hand is so warm  and the rest of her is so cold?"
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
"You have not let it go."
If there is a sinew in our family,  it runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life had shaped us,  we can now see  that the men who might have come into our lives  would have thwarted us.
Defeat would have come too easily.
Now I would like to have my own children,  and I wonder about the boat.
Who could ever wish it on their own?
Yet I am afraid of privilege,  of ease,  of entitlement.
Can I give them a bow in their lives,  dipping bravely into each wave,  the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine,  the vast horizon  that guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it  and still see them safely through,  I would.
Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today  in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan  about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the starry skies  with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
And we were in conversation  about how nothing had changed  since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel  we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.
Now we do the same with airplanes.
Back then,  when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,  when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,  he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
Now we do the same  with drills and machines.
The conclusion that we came to  was that magic had been replaced  by machinery.
And this made me really sad.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
I was terrified by this idea  that I would lose the ability  to enjoy and appreciate the sunset  without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
And it felt like technology  should enable magic, not kill it.
When I was a little girl,  my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
And this piece of 50-year-old technology  became the most magical thing to me.
It became a gilded gateway  into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks  and images in my imagination.
So I felt like our cellphones  and our fancy watches and our cameras  had stopped us from dreaming.
They stopped us from being inspired.
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,  to see how I could use it to enable magic  as opposed to kill it.
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.
And so when I saw the iPad,  I saw it as a storytelling device  that could connect readers all over the world.
It can know how we're holding it.
It can know where we are.
It brings together image and text  and animation and sound and touch.
Storytelling is becoming  more and more multi-sensorial.
But what are we doing with it?
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,  an interactive app for the iPad.
So it says, "Place your fingers  upon each light."
And so --    It says, "This box belongs to ... "  And so I type in my name.
And actually I become a character in the book.
At various points, a little letter drops down to me --  and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --  which is actually addressed to me.
The child in me is really excited  by these kinds of possibilities.
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
And I don't mean wizards and dragons,  I mean the kind of childhood magic,  those ideas that we all harbored as children.
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,  was always really exciting to me.
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,  take the fireflies out.
And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child  was that an entire galaxy could be contained  within a single marble.
And so over here,  each book and each world  becomes a little marble  that I drag in  to this magical device within the device.
And it opens up a map.
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,  but these maps have been static.
This is a map that grows and glows  and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
So I'm just going to enter in.
Another thing that's actually really important to me  is creating content that is Indian  and yet very contemporary.
Over here, these are the Apsaras.
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,  but how many people outside of India  know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years  in an old and musty book.
And so we're bringing them back  in a contemporary story for children.
And a story that actually deals with new issues  like the environmental crisis.
Speaking of the environmental crisis,  I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years  is that children have been locked inside their rooms,  glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.
But now with mobile technology,  we can actually take our children outside into the natural world  with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book  is that you're sent off on this quest  where you need to go outside,  take out your camera on the iPad  and collect pictures of different natural objects.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections  of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.
So in bringing back this childhood ritual,  you need to go out  and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower  and then tag it.
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark  and then tag that.
And what happens  is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs  that you can then put up online.
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox  and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."
And it creates this kind of social network  around a collection of digital photographs  that you've actually taken.
In the possibilities of linking together  magic, the earth and technology,  there are multiple possibilities.
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction  where you take your iPad out with the video on  and through augmented reality,  you see this layer of animated pixies  appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away  and read the rest of the book.
We're moving, we're all moving here,  to a world where the forces of nature  come closer together to technology,  and magic and technology can come closer together.
We're harnessing energy from the sun.
We're bringing our children and ourselves  closer to the natural world  and that magic and joy  and childhood love that we had  through the simple medium of a story.
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you  about why many e-health projects fail.
And I really think that the most important thing of it  is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at Radboud University  is we appointed a chief listening officer.
Not in a very scientific way --  she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea  and asks patients, family, relatives,  "What's up?
How could we help you?"
And we think, we like to think,  that this is one of the major problems  why all -- maybe not all --  but most of the e-health projects fail,  since we stopped listening.
This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It's got one knob, on/off.
And every morning I hop on it.
And yes, I've got a challenge,  as you might see.
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.
But the thing is that it's made this simple  that whenever I hop on,  it sends my data through Google Health as well.
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well,  so he can see what's my problem in weight,  not on the very moment  that I need cardiologic support or something like it,  but also looking backward.
But there's another thing.
As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning  I hop on my WiFi scale  and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me,  "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien."
But that's the nicest thing that could happen,  since this is peer pressure,  peer pressure used to help patients --  since this could be used for obesity,  it could be used  to stop smoking in patients.
But on the other hand, it also could be used  to get people from out of their chairs  and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity  to get more control of their health.
As of next week, it will soon be available.
There will be this little blood pressure meter  connected to an iPhone or something or other.
And people will be able, from their homes,  to take their blood pressure,  send it into their doctor  and eventually share it with others, for instance,  for over a hundred dollars.
And this is the point where patients get into position  and can collect, not only their own control again,  be captain of their own ship,  but also can help us in health care  due to the challenges that we face,  like health care cost explosion,  doubled demand and things like that.
Make techniques that are easy to use  and start with this to embrace patients in the team.
And you can do this with techniques like this,  but also by crowd-sourcing.
And one of the things we did  I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.
We've all got navigation controls in our car.
We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone.
We know perfectly where all the ATMs are  about the city of Maastricht.
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.
And sure, we could find fast food chains.
But where would be the nearest AED  to help this patient?
We asked around and nobody knew.
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED  was to be obtained right now.
So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands.
We set up a website  and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED,  please submit it, tell us where it is,  tell us when it's open,"  since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course.
And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands  already have been submitted.
The next step we took was to find the applications for it.
And we built an iPad application.
We made an application for Layar, augmented reality,  to find these AEDs.
And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses,  you can use your iPhone,  and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone,  to find the nearest AED  which can save lives.
And as of today,  we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU,  which is what the product is called,  but also AED4US.
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.
And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world,  colleague universities, to help us  to find and work and act like a hub  to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world.
That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses,  might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you,  you can find this.
The other thing we would like to ask  is of companies also all over the world  that will be able to help us validate these AEDs.
These might be courier services  or cable guys for instance,  just to see whether the AED that's submitted  still is in place.
So please help us on this one  and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it.
Thank you.
I'm here to share my photography.
Or is it photography?
Because, of course, this is a photograph  that you can't take with your camera.
Yet, my interest in photography started  as I got my first digital camera  at the age of 15.
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,  but it was a bit different,  because using the camera,  the process was in the planning instead.
And when you take a photograph with a camera,  the process ends when you press the trigger.
So to me it felt like photography was more about  being at the right place and the right time.
I felt like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different,  something where the process starts  when you press the trigger.
Photos like this:  construction going on along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite that,  it retains a level of realism.
Or photos like these --  both dark and colorful,  but all with a common goal  of retaining the level of realism.
When I say realism,  I mean photo-realism.
Because, of course,  it's not something you can capture really,  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow  as a photograph.
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think  to figure out the trick.
So it's more about capturing an idea  than about capturing a moment really.
But what's the trick  that makes it look realistic?
Is it something about the details  or the colors?
Is it something about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world  and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really what is realistic,  it's what we think looks realistic really.
So I think the basics  are quite simple.
I just see it as a puzzle of reality  where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together  to create alternate reality.
And let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,  something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way,  they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,  like it could exist.
But at the same time, we know it can't.
So we trick our brains,  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact  that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process  with combining photographs.
It's just really about combining different realities.
So the things that make a photograph look realistic,  I think it's the things that we don't even think about,  the things all around us in our daily lives.
But when combining photographs,  this is really important to consider,  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow  to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photos combined  should have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos combined  should have the same type of light.
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --  shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish  where the different images begin and end  by making it seamless.
Make it impossible to say  how the image actually was composed.
So here's another example.
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape  and the lower part is what's manipulated.
But this image is actually entirely composed  of photographs from different locations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place  than to find a place,  because then you don't need to compromise  with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of planning.
And getting this idea during winter,  I knew that I had several months to plan it,  to find the different locations  for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
So for example,  the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red  to make it look more Swedish.
So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then it's about combining the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well planned.
And if you do a good job capturing the photos,  the result can be quite beautiful  and also quite realistic.
So all the tools are out there,  and the only thing that limits us  is our imagination.
Thank you.
So I'm going to start out  by showing just one very boring technology slide.
And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.
This is just a random slide  that I picked out of my file.
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,  but the general form of it.
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing  about the power of RISC microprocessors  versus the power of local area networks.
And the interesting thing about it  is that this slide,  like so many technology slides that we're used to,  is a sort of a straight line  on a semi-log curve.
In other words, every step here  represents an order of magnitude  in performance scale.
And this is a new thing  that we talk about technology  on semi-log curves.
Something really weird is going on here.
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.
So, if you could bring up the lights.
If you could bring up the lights higher,  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.
Now why do we draw technology curves  in semi-log curves?
Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve  where, let's say, this is years,  this is time of some sort,  and this is whatever measure of the technology  that I'm trying to graph,  the graphs look sort of silly.
They sort of go like this.
And they don't tell us much.
Now if I graph, for instance,  some other technology, say transportation technology,  on a semi-log curve,  it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.
But when something like this happens,  things are qualitatively changing.
So if transportation technology  was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,  then the day after tomorrow,  I would be able to get in a taxi cab  and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
It's not moving like that.
And there's nothing precedented  in the history of technology development  of this kind of self-feeding growth  where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.
Now the question that I'd like to ask is,  if you look at these exponential curves,  they don't go on forever.
Things just can't possibly keep changing  as fast as they are.
One of two things is going to happen.
Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,  until something totally different comes along,  or maybe it's going to do this.
That's about all it can do.
Now I'm an optimist,  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now  is a transition.
We're sort of on this line  in a transition from the way the world used to be  to some new way that the world is.
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,  is what's this new way that the world is?
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?
Because the transition seems very, very confusing  when we're right in the middle of it.
Now when I was a kid growing up,  the future was kind of the year 2000,  and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
Now here's a conference  in which people talk about the future,  and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.
It's about as far as we go out.
So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking  one year per year  for my whole lifetime.
Now I think that the reason  is because we all feel  that something's happening there.
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense  to think out 30, 50 years  because everything's going to be so different  that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing  just doesn't make any sense at all.
So what I would like to talk about  is what that could be,  what that transition could be that we're going through.
Now in order to do that  I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff  that really has nothing to do  with technology and computers.
Because I think the only way to understand this  is to really step back  and take a long time scale look at things.
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on  is the time scale of life on Earth.
So I think this picture makes sense  if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
So if you go back  about two and a half billion years,  the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock  with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.
And if you look at the way  that the chemicals got organized,  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.
And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand  about how it started with RNA,  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,  which is that, at that time,  there were little drops of oil floating around  with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.
And some of those drops of oil  had a particular combination of chemicals in them  which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside  and grow the drops of oil.
And those that were like that  started to split and divide.
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,  those little drops of oil.
But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,  because every one of them  was a little random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it divided,  they got sort of unequal division  of the chemicals within them.
And so every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that were different in a way  that caused them to be better  at incorporating chemicals around them,  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.
So those tended to live longer,  get expressed more.
Now that's sort of just a very simple  chemical form of life,  but when things got interesting  was when these drops  learned a trick about abstraction.
Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,  these little drops learned to write down information.
They learned to record the information  that was the recipe of the cell  onto a particular kind of chemical  called DNA.
So in other words, they worked out,  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,  a form of writing that let them write down what they were,  so that that way of writing it down could get copied.
The amazing thing is that that way of writing  seems to have stayed steady  since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
In fact the recipe for us, our genes,  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.
In fact, every living creature is written  in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
In fact, one of the things that I did  just for amusement purposes  is we can now write things in this code.
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,  which I try not to let the security people see at airports.
But this has in it --  what I did is I took this code --  the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --  and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA  and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,  I have plenty for everyone in the room,  and, in fact, everyone in the world,  and it's right here.
If I had really been a egotist,  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
So what was the next step?
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.
And that caused these cells --  that kept them happy for another billion years.
But then there was another really interesting step  where things became completely different,  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,  so that they began to get communities of cells.
I don't know if you know this,  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.
Now that's why, for instance,  antibiotic resistance has evolved.
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information  with other bacteria,  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,  because bacteria communicate.
Now what this communication allowed  was communities to form  that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;  they were synergistic.
So they survived  or they failed together,  which means that if a community was very successful,  all the individuals in that community  were repeated more  and they were favored by evolution.
Now the transition point happened  when these communities got so close  that, in fact, they got together  and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community  together on one string of DNA.
And so the next stage that's interesting in life  took about another billion years.
And at that stage,  we have multi-cellular communities,  communities of lots of different types of cells,  working together as a single organism.
And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.
We have lots of cells  that are not out for themselves anymore.
Your skin cell is really useless  without a heart cell, muscle cell,  a brain cell and so on.
So these communities began to evolve  so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place  was no longer a cell,  but a community which we call an organism.
Now the next step that happened  is within these communities.
These communities of cells,  again, began to abstract information.
And they began building very special structures  that did nothing but process information within the community.
And those are the neural structures.
So neurons are the information processing apparatus  that those communities of cells built up.
And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community  and special structures  that were responsible for recording,  understanding, learning information.
And that was the brains and the nervous system  of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that point,  an individual --  learning could happen  within the time span of a single organism,  instead of over this evolutionary time span.
So an organism could, for instance,  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit  because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily  over hundreds of thousands of years  by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.
So that nervous system,  the fact that they built these special information structures,  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.
It could happen in learning time scales.
But then what happened  was the individuals worked out,  of course, tricks of communicating.
And for example,  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.
Here I have a very complicated, messy,  confused idea in my head.
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,  and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head  that bears some analogy to it.
But we're taking something very complicated,  turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,  and producing something very complicated in your brain.
So this allows us now  to begin to start functioning  as a single organism.
And so, in fact, what we've done  is we, humanity,  have started abstracting out.
We're going through the same levels  that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --  abstracting out our methods of recording,  presenting, processing information.
So for example, the invention of language  was a tiny step in that direction.
Telephony, computers,  videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on  are all our specialized mechanisms  that we've now built within our society  for handling that information.
And it all connects us together  into something  that is much bigger  and much faster  and able to evolve  than what we were before.
So now, evolution can take place  on a scale of microseconds.
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example  where he sort of did a little bit of evolution  on the Convolution program right before your eyes.
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.
So the first steps of the story that I told you about  took a billion years a piece.
And the next steps,  like nervous systems and brains,  took a few hundred million years.
Then the next steps, like language and so on,  took less than a million years.
And these next steps, like electronics,  seem to be taking only a few decades.
The process is feeding on itself  and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --  when something reinforces its rate of change.
The more it changes, the faster it changes.
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.
Now I design computers for a living,  and I know that the mechanisms  that I use to design computers  would be impossible  without recent advances in computers.
So right now, what I do  is I design objects at such complexity  that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
There are billions of them.
Instead, what I do  and what the designers at Thinking Machines do  is we think at some level of abstraction  and then we hand it to the machine  and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,  much farther and faster than we could ever do.
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods  that we don't quite even understand.
One method that's particularly interesting  that I've been using a lot lately  is evolution itself.
So what we do  is we put inside the machine  a process of evolution  that takes place on the microsecond time scale.
So for example,  in the most extreme cases,  we can actually evolve a program  by starting out with random sequences of instructions.
Say, "Computer, would you please make  a hundred million random sequences of instructions.
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,  run all of those programs,  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."
So in other words, I define what I wanted.
Let's say I want to sort numbers,  as a simple example I've done it with.
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.
So of course, random sequences of instructions  are very unlikely to sort numbers,  so none of them will really do it.
But one of them, by luck,  may put two numbers in the right order.
And I say, "Computer,  would you please now take the 10 percent  of those random sequences that did the best job.
Save those. Kill off the rest.
And now let's reproduce  the ones that sorted numbers the best.
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination  analogous to sex."
Take two programs and they produce children  by exchanging their subroutines,  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.
So I've got now a new generation of programs  that are produced by combinations  of the programs that did a little bit better job.
Say, "Please repeat that process."
Score them again.
Introduce some mutations perhaps.
And try that again and do that for another generation.
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent  of millions of years of evolution on that  within the computer in a few minutes,  or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end of that, I end up with programs  that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.
In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient  than programs I could have ever written by hand.
Now if I look at those programs,  I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.
They're obscure, weird programs.
But they do the job.
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job  because they come from a line  of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
In fact, their life depended on doing the job.
I was riding in a 747  with Marvin Minsky once,  and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.
It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts  working together to make you a safe flight.'  Doesn't that make you feel confident?"
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well  when it gets complicated.
So we're beginning to depend on computers  to do a process that's very different than engineering.
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity  than normal engineering lets us produce.
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.
So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.
We're now using those programs  to make much faster computers  so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.
So it's feeding back on itself.
The thing is becoming faster  and that's why I think it seems so confusing.
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.
We're taking off.
And what we are is we're at a point in time  which is analogous to when single-celled organisms  were turning into multi-celled organisms.
So we're the amoebas  and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.
We're right at that point of transition.
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.
I think it's very haughty of us  to think that we're the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us here  are a part of producing  whatever that next thing is.
So lunch is coming along,  and I think I will stop at that point,  before I get selected out.
I think we have to do something  about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.
And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.
And maybe I've been around long enough  that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige  to be able to do that.
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk,  let's begin with a bit of baseball.
Hey, why not?
We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.
We all love baseball, don't we?
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics.
And there's hundreds of them.
"Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics  and using statistics to build a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one stat  that I hope a lot of you have heard of.
It's called batting average.
So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.
That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely  three times out of 10 at bats.
That means hit the ball into the outfield,  it dropped, it didn't get caught,  and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time  and the runner was safe.
Three times out of 10.
Do you know what they call a 300 hitter  in Major League Baseball?
Good, really good,  maybe an all-star.
Do you know what they call  a 400 baseball hitter?
That's somebody who hit, by the way,  four times safely out of every 10.
Legendary --  as in Ted Williams legendary --  the last Major League Baseball player  to hit over 400 during a regular season.
Now let's take this back into my world of medicine  where I'm a lot more comfortable,  or perhaps a bit less comfortable  after what I'm going to talk to you about.
Suppose you have appendicitis  and you're referred to a surgeon  who's batting 400 on appendectomies.
Somehow this isn't working out, is it?
Now suppose you live  in a certain part of a certain remote place  and you have a loved one  who has blockages in two coronary arteries  and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist  who's batting 200 on angioplasties.
But, but, you know what?
She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail.
And she's hitting a 257.
Somehow this isn't working.
But I'm going to ask you a question.
What do you think a batting average  for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner  or an orthopedic surgeon,  an OBGYN, a paramedic  is supposed to be?
1,000, very good.
Now truth of the matter is,  nobody knows in all of medicine  what a good surgeon  or physician or paramedic  is supposed to bat.
What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself,  out into the world  with the admonition, be perfect.
Never ever, ever make a mistake,  but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.
And that was the message that I absorbed  when I was in med school.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
In high school, a classmate once said  that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test.
And so I did.
And I studied in my little garret  at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital,  not far from here.
And I memorized everything.
I memorized in my anatomy class  the origins and exertions of every muscle,  every branch of every artery that came off the aorta,  differential diagnoses obscure and common.
I even knew the differential diagnosis  in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.
And all the while,  I was amassing more and more knowledge.
And I did well, I graduated with honors,  cum laude.
And I came out of medical school  with the impression  that if I memorized everything and knew everything,  or as much as possible,  as close to everything as possible,  that it would immunize me against making mistakes.
And it worked  for a while,  until I met Mrs. Drucker.
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto  when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department  of the hospital where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service  on a cardiology rotation.
And it was my job,  when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult,  to see that patient in emerg.
and to report back to my attending.
And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.
And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.
And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope,  I could hear crackly sounds on both sides  that told me that she was in congestive heart failure.
This is a condition in which the heart fails,  and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward,  some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood,  and that's why you have shortness of breath.
And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.
I made it and I set to work treating her.
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.
I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills,  to get her to pee out the access fluid.
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two,  she started to feel better.
And I felt really good.
And that's when I made my first mistake;  I sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home  without speaking to my attending.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,  which was call my attending and run the story by him  so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
And he knew her,  he would have been able to furnish additional information about her.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful  and so able to take responsibility  that I would do so  and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients  without even having to contact him.
The second mistake that I made was worse.
In sending her home,  I disregarded a little voice deep down inside  that was trying to tell me,  "Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."
In fact, so lacking in confidence was I  that I actually asked the nurse  who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,  "Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"
And the nurse thought about it  and said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay."
I can remember that like it was yesterday.
So I signed the discharge papers,  and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.
And I went back to my work on the wards.
All the rest of that day,  that afternoon,  I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.
But I carried on with my work.
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital  and walked to the parking lot  to take my car and drive home  when I did something that I don't usually do.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And it was there that another nurse,  not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,  said three words to me  that are the three words  that most emergency physicians I know dread.
Others in medicine dread them as well,  but there's something particular about emergency medicine  because we see patients so fleetingly.
The three words are:  Do you remember?
"Do you remember that patient you sent home?"
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.
"Well she's back,"  in just that tone of voice.
Well she was back all right.
She was back and near death.
About an hour after she had arrived home,  after I'd sent her home,  she collapsed and her family called 911  and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department  where she had a blood pressure of 50,  which is in severe shock.
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.
They put her on a ventilator.
And I was shocked  and shaken to the core.
And I went through this roller coaster,  because after they stabilized her,  she went to the intensive care unit,  and I hoped against hope that she would recover.
And over the next two or three days,  it was clear that she was never going to wake up.
She had irreversible brain damage.
And the family gathered.
And over the course of the next eight or nine days,  they resigned themselves to what was happening.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go --  Mrs. Drucker,  a wife, a mother  and a grandmother.
They say you never forget the names  of those who die.
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that.
Over the next few weeks,  I beat myself up  and I experienced for the first time  the unhealthy shame that exists  in our culture of medicine --  where I felt alone, isolated,  not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel,  because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again.
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about  is the one that makes you so sick inside.
It's the one that says,  not that what you did was bad,  but that you are bad.
And it was what I was feeling.
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over  and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And I kept asking myself these questions.
Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?
And then at my worst moments:  Why did I make such a stupid mistake?
Why did I go into medicine?
Slowly but surely,  it lifted.
I began to feel a bit better.
And on a cloudy day,  there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out  and I wondered,  maybe I could feel better again.
And I made myself a bargain  that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect  and never make another mistake again,  please make the voices stop.
And they did.
And I went back to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department  at a community hospital just north of Toronto,  and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
He kept pointing here.
I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin  and sent him on his way.
And even as he was walking out the door,  he was still sort of pointing to his throat.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift,  and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And she said the three words:  Do you remember?
"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"
Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
He had a potentially life-threatening condition  called epiglottitis.
You can Google it,  but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway,  and it can actually cause the airway to close.
And fortunately he didn't die.
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics  and he recovered after a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations  and felt cleansed and went back to work,  until it happened again and again and again.
Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.
Now that takes some doing,  especially when you work in a hospital  that at the time saw but 14 people a night.
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home  and I don't think there was any gap in their care.
One I thought had a kidney stone.
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal,  my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient  noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him  and asked my colleague to reassess him.
And he did  and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
In both cases,  they had their operations and they did okay.
But each time,  they were gnawing at me, eating at me.
And I'd like to be able to say to you  that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice  as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.
Some of my doozies have been in the last five years.
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.
Here's the problem:  If I can't come clean  and talk about my mistakes,  if I can't find the still-small voice  that tells me what really happened,  how can I share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them about what I did  so that they don't do the same thing?
If I were to walk into a room --  like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk  about failure after failure after failure?
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party  and you might hear about some other doctor,  but you're not going to hear somebody  talking about their own mistakes.
And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew  that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital,  believe me, I'd have trouble  making eye contact with that person.
That's the system that we have.
It's a complete denial of mistakes.
It's a system  in which there are two kinds of physicians --  those who make mistakes  and those who don't,  those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can,  those who have lousy outcomes  and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction,  like the antibodies begin to attack that person.
And we have this idea  that if we drive the people who make mistakes  out of medicine,  what will we be left with, but a safe system.
But there are two problems with that.
In my 20 years or so  of medical broadcasting and journalism,  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors  to learn everything I can,  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star  to my show "White Coat, Black Art."
And what I've learned  is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
We work in a system  where errors happen every day,  where one in 10 medications  are either the wrong medication given in hospital  or at the wrong dosage,  where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous,  causing havoc and death.
In this country,  as many as 24,000 Canadians die  of preventable medical errors.
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
In both cases, these are gross underestimates,  because we really aren't ferreting out the problem  as we should.
And here's the thing.
In a hospital system  where medical knowledge is doubling  every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
We can't get rid of it.
We have our cognitive biases,  so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
Now take the same patient with chest pain,  make them moist and garrulous  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath,  and suddenly my history is laced with contempt.
I don't take the same history.
I'm not a robot;  I don't do things the same way each time.
And my patients aren't cars;  they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.
Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable.
So if you take the system, as I was taught,  and weed out all the error-prone health professionals,  well there won't be anybody left.
And you know that business  about people not wanting  to talk about their worst cases?
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"  I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake,"  I would say to everybody  from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,  "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  "What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.
And their pupils would dilate,  they would recoil,  then they would look down and swallow hard  and start to tell me their stories.
They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say,  "Look, don't make the same mistake I did."
What they need is an environment to be able to do that.
What they need is a redefined medical culture.
And it starts with one physician at a time.
The redefined physician is human,  knows she's human,  accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes,  but strives to learn one thing  from what happened  that she can teach to somebody else.
She shares her experience with others.
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
And she points out other people's mistakes,  not in a gotcha way,  but in a loving, supportive way  so that everybody can benefit.
And she works in a culture of medicine  that acknowledges  that human beings run the system,  and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am a redefined physician.
I'm human. I make mistakes.
I'm sorry about that,  but I strive to learn one thing  that I can pass on to other people.
I still don't know what you think of me,  but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words of my own:  I do remember.
Do you know how many choices you make  in a typical day?
Do you know how many choices you make  in typical week?
I recently did a survey  with over 2,000 Americans,  and the average number of choices  that the typical American reports making  is about 70 in a typical day.
There was also recently a study done with CEOs  in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks  that these CEOs engaged in  and how much time they spent engaging  in making decisions related to these tasks.
And they found that the average CEO  engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.
50 percent of their decisions  were made in nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent of the decisions  did they make an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own choices.
Do you know how many choices  make it into your nine minute category  versus your one hour category?
How well do you think you're doing  at managing those choices?
Today I want to talk  about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,  which is the choice overload problem.
I want to talk about the problem  and some potential solutions.
Now as I talk about this problem,  I'm going to have some questions for you  and I'm going to want to know your answers.
So when I ask you a question,  since I'm blind,  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.
Otherwise, when I ask you a question,  and if your answer is yes,  I'd like you to clap your hands.
So for my first question for you today:  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?
Thank you.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,  I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;  at least at that time it was truly upscale.
It was a store called Draeger's.
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars  and over 500 different kinds  of fruits and vegetables  and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --  and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
I used to love going to this store,  but on one occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything?
Here's their olive oil aisle.
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,  including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually.
We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment.
Here's their jam aisle.
They had 348 different kinds of jam.
We set up a little tasting booth  right near the entrance of the store.
We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.
The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.
Now we see the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.
Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.
Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  if they encountered six  than if they encountered 24.
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions.
We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did  with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans  from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.
And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow.
And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.
So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile.
Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.
So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts.
Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.
Well, over the past decade,  we have observed three main negative consequences  to offering people more and more choices.
They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices.
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better.
The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.
So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses.
The first: Cut.
You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more  is that if you are willing to cut,  get rid of those extraneous redundant options,  well there's an increase in sales,  there's a lowering of costs,  there is an improvement of the choosing experience.
When Proctor & Gamble  went from 26 different kinds of Head & Shoulders to 15,  they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
When the Golden Cat Corporation  got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,  they saw an increase in profits  by 87 percent --  a function of both increase in sales  and lowering of costs.
You know, the average grocery store today  offers you 45,000 products.
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest retailer,  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today  is Aldi,  and it offers you only 1,400 products --  one kind of canned tomato sauce.
Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard.
Every single Harvard employee  is now automatically enrolled  in a lifecycle fund.
For those people who actually want to choose,  they're given 20 funds,  not 300 or more funds.
You know, often, people say,  "I don't know how to cut.
They're all important choices."
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,  "Tell me how these choices are different from one another.
And if your employees can't tell them apart,  neither can your consumers."
Now before we started our session this afternoon,  I had a chat with Gary.
And Gary said that he would be willing  to offer people in this audience  an all-expenses-paid free vacation  to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here's a description of the road.
And I'd like you to read it.
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it  and then I want you to clap your hands  if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.
(Light clapping)  Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.
Is that all?
All right, let me show you some more about this.
You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.
Now who's ready to go on this trip.
I think I might have actually heard more hands.
All right.
Now in fact,  you had objectively more information  the first time around than the second time around,  but I would venture to guess  that you felt that it was more real the second time around.
Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you.
Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization.
That in order for people to understand  the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more  when they use an ATM card or a credit card  as opposed to cash?
Because it doesn't feel like real money.
And it turns out  that making it feel more concrete  can actually be a very positive tool  to use in getting people to save more.
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi  and Alessandro Previtero,  we did a study with people at ING --  employees that are all working at ING --  and now these people were all in a session  where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.
And during that session,  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,  but we added one little thing.
The one little thing we added  was we asked people  to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life  if you saved more.
By doing that simple thing,  there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent  and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save  or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account  by four percent.
The third technique: Categorization.
We can handle more categories  than we can handle choices.
So for example,  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores  up and down the northeast corridor,  the magazine aisles range anywhere  from 331 different kinds of magazines  all the way up to 664.
But you know what?
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.
Here are two different jewelry displays.
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."
If you think the display on the left is Swing  and the display on the right is Jazz,  clap your hands.
(Light Clapping)  Okay, there's some.
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  clap your hands.
Okay, a bit more.
Now it turns out you're right.
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  but you know what?
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.
The categories need to say something  to the chooser, not the choice-maker.
And you often see that problem  when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.
It turns out we can actually  handle a lot more information than we think we can,  we've just got to take it a little easier.
We have to gradually increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
Let's take a very, very complicated decision:  buying a car.
Here's a German car manufacturer  that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.
You've got to make 60 different decisions,  completely make up your car.
Now these decisions vary  in the number of choices that they offer per decision.
Car colors, exterior car colors --  I've got 56 choices.
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.
So now what I'm going to do  is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.
So half of the customers  are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,  to low choice, four gearshifts.
The other half of the customers  are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,  to 56 car colors, high choice.
What am I going to look at?
How engaged you are.
If you keep hitting the default button per decision,  that means you're getting overwhelmed,  that means I'm losing you.
What you find  is the people who go from high choice to low choice,  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.
We're losing them.
They go from low choice to high choice,  they're hanging in there.
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.
The only thing that I have done  is I have varied the order  in which that information is presented.
If I start you off easy,  I learn how to choose.
Even though choosing gearshift  doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,  it still prepares me for how to choose.
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,  so I'm more willing to be motivated  to be engaged.
So let me recap.
I have talked about four techniques  for mitigating the problem of choice overload --  cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;  concretize -- make it real;  categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;  condition for complexity.
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today  are designed to help you manage your choices --  better for you, you can use them on yourself,  better for the people that you are serving.
Because I believe that the key  to getting the most from choice  is to be choosy about choosing.
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing  the better we will be able  to practice the art of choosing.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s  in the communist Eastern Germany,  if you owned a typewriter,  you had to register it with the government.
You had to register  a sample sheet of text  out of the typewriter.
And this was done  so the government could track where text was coming from.
If they found a paper  which had the wrong kind of thought,  they could track down  who created that thought.
And we in the West  couldn't understand how anybody could do this,  how much this would restrict freedom of speech.
We would never do that  in our own countries.
But today in 2011,  if you go and buy a color laser printer  from any major laser printer manufacturer  and print a page,  that page will end up  having slight yellow dots  printed on every single page  in a pattern which makes the page unique  to you and to your printer.
This is happening  to us today.
And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.
And this is an example  of the ways  that our own governments  are using technology  against us, the citizens.
And this is one of the main three sources  of online problems today.
If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world,  we can group the attacks based on the attackers.
We have three main groups.
We have online criminals.
Like here, we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov  from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
And the motives of online criminals  are very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use online attacks  to make lots of money,  and lots and lots of it.
We actually have several cases  of millionaires online, multimillionaires,  who made money with their attacks.
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour  and so on and so on.
These guys  make their fortunes online,  but they make it through the illegal means  of using things like banking trojans  to steal money from our bank accounts  while we do online banking,  or with keyloggers  to collect our credit card information  while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
The U.S. Secret Service,  two months ago,  froze the Swiss bank account  of Mr. Sam Jain right here,  and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it  when it was frozen.
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;  nobody knows where he is.
And I claim it's already today  that it's more likely for any of us  to become the victim of a crime online  than here in the real world.
And it's very obvious  that this is only going to get worse.
In the future, the majority of crime  will be happening online.
The second major group of attackers  that we are watching today  are not motivated by money.
They're motivated by something else --  motivated by protests,  motivated by an opinion,  motivated by the laughs.
Groups like Anonymous  have risen up over the last 12 months  and have become a major player  in the field of online attacks.
So those are the three main attackers:  criminals who do it for the money,  hacktivists like Anonymous  doing it for the protest,  but then the last group are nation states,  governments doing the attacks.
And then we look at cases  like what happened in DigiNotar.
This is a prime example of what happens  when governments attack  against their own citizens.
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority  from The Netherlands --  or actually, it was.
It was running into bankruptcy  last fall  because they were hacked into.
Somebody broke in  and they hacked it thoroughly.
And I asked last week  in a meeting with Dutch government representatives,  I asked one of the leaders of the team  whether he found plausible  that people died  because of the DigiNotar hack.
And his answer was yes.
So how do people die  as the result of a hack like this?
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.
They sell certificates.
What do you do with certificates?
Well you need a certificate  if you have a website that has https,  SSL encrypted services,  services like Gmail.
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates.
And this is exactly what happened  with the case of DigiNotar.
What about Arab Spring  and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?
Well in Egypt,  the rioters looted the headquarters  of the Egyptian secret police  in April 2011,  and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers.
Among those papers,  was this binder entitled "FINFISHER."
And within that binder were notes  from a company based in Germany  which had sold the Egyptian government  a set of tools  for intercepting --  and in very large scale --  all the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool  for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government.
The company headquarters are right here.
So Western governments  are providing totalitarian governments with tools  to do this against their own citizens.
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
For example, in Germany,  just a couple of weeks ago  the so-called State Trojan was found,  which was a trojan  used by German government officials  to investigate their own citizens.
If you are a suspect in a criminal case,  well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.
But today, it goes beyond that.
They will tap your Internet connection.
They will even use tools like State Trojan  to infect your computer with a trojan,  which enables them  to watch all your communication,  to listen to your online discussions,  to collect your passwords.
Now when we think deeper  about things like these,  the obvious response from people should be  that, "Okay, that sounds bad,  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen.
Why should I worry?
Because I have nothing to hide."
And this is an argument,  which doesn't make sense.
Privacy is implied.
Privacy is not up for discussion.
This is not a question  between privacy  against security.
It's a question of freedom  against control.
And while we might trust our governments  right now, right here in 2011,  any right we give away will be given away for good.
And do we trust, do we blindly trust,  any future government,  a government we might have  50 years from now?
And these are the questions  that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya,  at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.
Those are my dad's cows at the back,  and behind the cows,  that's the Nairobi National Park.
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,  which means wild animals like zebras  migrate out of the park freely.
So predators like lions follow them,  and this is what they do.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of the cows which was killed at night,  and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,  and I felt so bad,  because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the Maasai, we believe that  we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land  for herding them, and that's why we value them so much.
So I grew up hating lions so much.
The morans are the warriors  who protect our community and the livestock,  and they're also upset about this problem.
So they kill the lions.
It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.
So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community  is responsible for his dad's cows,  and that's the same thing which happened to me.
So I had to find a way of solving this problem.
And the first idea I got was to use fire,  because I thought lions were scared of fire.
But I came to realize that that didn't really help,  because it was even helping the lions  to see through the cowshed.
So I didn't give up. I continued.
And a second idea I got was  to use a scarecrow.
I was trying to trick the lions  [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.
But lions are very clever.   They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,  but the second day, they'll come and they say,  this thing is not moving here, it's always here.   So he jumps in and kills the animals.
So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,  and that day, the lions didn't come.
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.
So I set up everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,  and the battery supplies the power  to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.
And the indicator box makes the lights flash.
As you can see, the bulbs face outside,  because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.
The lights flash and trick  the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,  but I was sleeping in my bed.
Thanks.
So I set it up in my home two years ago,  and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,  and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.
And I said, "Yes."
So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.
Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,  and they're really working.
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya  for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,  and it's also being used  to scare elephants away from people's farms.
Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship  in one of the best schools in Kenya,  Brookhouse International School,  and I'm really excited about this.
My new school now is coming in and helping  by fundraising and creating an awareness.
I even took my friends back to my community,  and we're installing the lights to the homes  which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.
So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland  herding my father's cows,  and I used to see planes flying over,  and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.
And here I am today.
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now because my invention  is saving my father's cows and the lions,  we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.
Ash oln. It means in my language, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is  to hear a story like yours.
So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on your list?
RT: My next invention is,  I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?
RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,  but I want to make mine.
CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,  but I stopped because it gave me a shock.   CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.
We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.
Thank you so much.RT: Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy."
And I was very proud.
In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,  but we never learned much about the outside world,  except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I often wondered about the outside world,  I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,  until everything suddenly changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor,  and myself, I had never experienced hunger.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter  from a coworker's sister.
It read, "When you read this,  our five family members will not exist in this world,  because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks.
We are lying on the floor together,  and our bodies are so weak, we are waiting to die."
I was so shocked.
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering.
Soon after, when I was walking past a train station,  I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory.
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,  while an emaciated child in her arms  just stared helplessly at his mother's face.
But nobody helped them,  because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s.
Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine,  and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark.
Power outages also became more and more frequent,  so everything around me was completely dark at night,  except for the sea of lights in China,  just across the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't.
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night,  compared to neighbors.
This is the Amnok River,  which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points,  allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.
I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea,  but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine,  I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family  for a short time.
I could have never imagined  that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family.
I had no idea what life was going to be like  as a North Korean refugee.
But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult,  it's also very dangerous,  since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants.
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed,  and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate,  back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare came true,  when I was caught by the Chinese police,  and brought to the police station for interrogation.
Someone had accused me of being North Korean,  so they tested my Chinese language abilities,  and asked me tons of questions.
I was so scared.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated.
I thought my life was over.
But I managed to control all the emotions inside me,  and answer the questions.
After they finished questioning me,  one official said to another,  "This was a false report. She's not North Korean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies.
But many can be caught by the Chinese police,  and repatriated.
These girls were so lucky.
Even though they were caught,  they were eventually released, after heavy international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China  and repatriated to North Korea,  where they can be tortured, imprisoned, or publicly executed.
Even though I was really fortunate to get out,  many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities  and struggle so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and getting a job,  their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity,  I decided to risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life yet again.
Settling down in South Korea  was a lot more challenging than I had expected.
English was so important in South Korea,  so I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South.
We are all Korean, but inside,  we have become very different, due to 67 years of division.
I even went through an identity crisis.
Am I South Korean or North Korean?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own.
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy,  I made a plan -- I started studying for the university entrance exam.
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life,  I received a shocking phone call.
The North Korean authorities intercepted some money  that I sent to my family,  and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed  to a desolate location in the countryside.
They had to get out quickly.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances  on the path to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border  between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight back to China  and headed toward the North Korean border.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,  I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles  in China, and then into Southeast Asia.
The journey by bus took one week,  and we were almost caught several times.
One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer.
He took everyone's I.D. cards,  and he started asking them questions.
Since my family couldn't understand Chinese,  I thought my family was going to be arrested.
As the Chinese officer approached my family,  I impulsively stood up, and I told him  that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning.
He looked at me suspiciously,  but luckily, he believed me.
We made it all the way to the border of Laos.
But I had to spend almost all my money  to bribe the border guards in Laos.
But even after we got past the border,  my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing.
After I paid the fine and bribe,  my family was released in one month.
But soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again,  in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to get my family to freedom,  and we came so close,  but my family was thrown in jail,  just a short distance from the South Korean embassy.
I went back and forth between the immigration office  and the police station,  desperately trying to get my family out.
but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore.
I lost all hope.
At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me,  "What's wrong?"
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask.
In my broken English, and with a dictionary,  I explained the situation, and without hesitating,  the man went to the ATM,  and he paid the rest of the money for my family,  and two other North Koreans to get out of jail.
I thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him,  "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not helping you," he said.
"I'm helping the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people,  when we needed it most.
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers  and the support of the international community  are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need.
Eventually, after our long journey,  my family and I were reunited in South Korea.
But getting to freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families,  and when they arrive in a new country,  they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community  for education, English language training, job training, and more.
We can also act as a bridge  between the people inside North Korea and the outside world.
Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside,  and we send information and money  that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life,  so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans  a chance to prosper with international support.
I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans  succeeding all over the world,  including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central:  liquor stores,  fast food,  vacant lots.
So the city planners, they get together and they figure  they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,  so they change it to South Los Angeles,  like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.   Liquor stores,  fast food,  vacant lots.
Just like 26.5 million other Americans,  I live in a food desert,  South Central Los Angeles,  home of the drive-thru and the drive-by.
Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.
People are dying from curable diseases  in South Central Los Angeles.
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood  is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,  which is probably eight, 10 miles away.
I got tired of seeing this happening.
And I was wondering, how would you feel  if you had no access to healthy food,  if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects  that the present food system has on your neighborhood?
I see wheelchairs bought and sold  like used cars.
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.
And I figured, this has to stop.
So I figured that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip  to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.
So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.
It's 150 feet by 10 feet.
Thing is, it's owned by the city.
But you have to maintain it.
So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,  since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."
And this is how I decided to maintain it.
So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together  and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,  you know, the whole nine, vegetables.
What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,  where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,  from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,  and everything we do is free.
And the garden, it was beautiful.
And then somebody complained.
The city came down on me,  and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,  which this citation was turning into a warrant.
And I'm like, "Come on, really?
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land  that you could care less about?"   And I was like, "Cool. Bring it."
Because this time it wasn't coming up.
So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it  and talked to the councilman,  and one of the Green Grounds members,  they put up a petition on Change.org,  and with 900 signatures, we were a success.
We had a victory on our hands.
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse  and love what we're doing.
I mean, come on, why wouldn't they?
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots.
That's 20 Central Parks.
That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why in the hell would they not okay this?
Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
When one dollar's worth of green beans  will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.
It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.
Growing your own food is like printing your own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality  that was manufactured for me by some other people,  and I'm manufacturing my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,  me, I beautify lawns, parkways.
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,  and the plants and the trees,  that's my embellishment for that cloth.
You'd be surprised what the soil could do  if you let it be your canvas.
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is  and how it affects people.
So what happened?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,  a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the soil.
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.
Gardening is the most therapeutic  and defiant act you can do,  especially in the inner city.
Plus you get strawberries.
I remember this time,  there was this mother and a daughter came,  it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,  and I came out and they looked so ashamed.
So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,  and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
It made me feel ashamed to see people  that were this close to me that were hungry,  and this only reinforced why I do this,  and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid  people are going to steal your food?"
And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.
That's why it's on the street.
That's the whole idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time,  I want them to take back their health."
There's another time when I put  a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.
It was cool, and they just shared the stories  about how this affected them and how  they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,  and it was just cool to see how this changed them,  if it was only for that one moment.
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant  maybe 20 gardens.
We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins  and participate, and it's all volunteers.
If kids grow kale, kids eat kale.
If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.   But when none of this is presented to them,  if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,  they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.
I see young people  and they want to work,  but they're in this thing where they're caught up --  I see kids of color and they're just on this track  that's designed for them,  that leads them to nowhere.
So with gardening, I see an opportunity  where we can train these kids  to take over their communities,  to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
We might produce the next George Washington Carver.
but if we don't change the composition of the soil,  we will never do this.
Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens  where people can share in the food in the same block.
I want to take shipping containers  and turn them into healthy cafes.
Now don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about no free shit,  because free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability,  you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is putting people to work,  and getting kids off the street, and letting them know  the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,  opening farmer's markets.
So what I want to do here,  we gotta make this sexy.
So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,  gangstas, gangsta gardeners.
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.
If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.
Get gangsta with your shovel, okay?
And let that be your weapon of choice.
So basically, if you want to meet with me,  you know, if you want to meet,  don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs  and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --  where you talk about doing some shit.
If you want to meet with me, come to the garden  with your shovel so we can plant some shit.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Microwave beeps)   You probably all agree with me  that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt,  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,  but not always, especially not on these days as today,  when it's raining a lot.
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,  and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material,  and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,  very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads  out of porous asphalt.
Porous asphalt, a material that we use now  in most of the highways in the Netherlands,  it has pores and water can just rain through it,  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,  and you have a road that's easy to drive on,  so no splash water anymore.
Also the noise will disappear in these pores.
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,  so it's a very silent road.
It also has disadvantages, of course,  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.
What is raveling? You see that in this road  that the stones at the surface come off.
First you get one stone, then several more,  and more and more and more and more,  and then they -- well, I will not do that.   But they can damage your windshield,  so you're not happy with that.
And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create potholes with that.
Ha. He's ready.
Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,  but we have a solution.
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.
It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only  a small amount of binder between the stones.
Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,  this binder, this bitumen,  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,  and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,  and it delaminates from the aggregates.
Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --  what we just saw here.
To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.
If we can make this material self-healing,  then probably we have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.
So then you have asphalt  with very small pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here,  that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.
Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.
Then what you do is you heat up the steel,  you melt the bitumen,  and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,  and the stones are again fixed to the surface.
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take  the big induction machine here onstage.
So a microwave is a similar system.
So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out  to see what happened.
So this is the specimen coming out now.
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab  to heat up the specimens.
We tested a lot of specimens there,  and then the government, they actually saw our results,  and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."
So they donated to us a piece of highway,  400 meters of the A58, where we had to make  a test track to test this material.
So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,  and then of course this road will last several years  without any damage. That's what we know from practice.
So we took a lot of samples from this road  and we tested them in the lab.
So we did aging on the samples,  did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,  and healed them and tested them again.
Several times we can repeat that.
Well, to conclude, I can say  that we made a material  using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,  using induction energy to really  increase the surface life of the road,  double the surface life you can even do,  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.
Actually, it still has to cool down first  before I can show you that the healing works.
But I will do a trial.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11,  I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News  on his small, gray radio.
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,  because the news mostly depressed him.
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.
I didn't know what it meant,  but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school now," he said.
A morning that I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan  and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy  to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed  to be outside alone, to a secret school.
It was the only way we both could be educated.
Each day, we took a different route  so that no one would suspect where we were going.
We would cover our books in grocery bags  so it would seem we were just out shopping.
The school was in a house,  more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives --  the teacher, the students and our parents.
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled  for a week because Taliban were suspicious.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we being followed?
Do they know where we live?
We were scared,  but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family  where education was prized and daughters were treasured.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,  he insisted that his daughter, my mom,  go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
There she is.
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house  into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father -- that's him --  he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
There was no question that his children  would receive an education, including his daughters,  despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
During Taliban years, I remember  there were times I would get so frustrated by our life  and always being scared and not seeing a future.
I would want to quit,  but my father,  he would say,  "Listen, my daughter,  you can lose everything you own in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
But the one thing that will always remain with you  is what is here,  and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,  we will.
So do you still not want to continue?"
Today I am 22.
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed  by decades of war.
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,  and had my family not been so committed to my education,  I would be one of them.
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,  the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,  was among the first to congratulate me.
He not only brags about my college degree,  but also that I was the first woman,  and that I am the first woman  to drive him through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,  a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLA,  the first and perhaps only boarding school  for girls in Afghanistan,  a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school  with ambition grabbing at opportunity.
And I see their parents and their fathers  who, like my own, advocate for them,  despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,  and I cannot show you his face,  but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter  were on their way from SOLA to their village,  and they literally missed being killed  by a roadside bomb by minutes.
As he arrived home, the phone rang,  a voice warning him  that if he sent his daughter back to school,  they would try again.
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,  "but I will not ruin my daughter's future  because of your old and backward ideas."
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,  and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,  that behind most of us who succeed  is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter  and who sees that her success is his success.
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators  of a bright future for their daughters,  but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,  we must have the support of men.
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school  numbered in the hundreds --  remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
I fear that these changes will not last  much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
But when I am back in Afghanistan,  when I see the students in my school  and their parents who advocate for them,  who encourage them, I see a promising future  and lasting change.
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,  and every single day  the girls of SOLA remind me of that.
Like me, they are dreaming big.
Thank you.
I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother  who died in her exile:  "Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.
But don't you ever turn  into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."
Almost two years have passed  since the Libyan Revolution broke out,  inspired by the waves of mass mobilization  in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya  to call for a day of rage  and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.
And there it was, a great revolution.
Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront  calling for the fall of the regime,  raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
They have shown an exemplary bravery  in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
They have shown a great sense of solidarity  from the far east to the far west to the south.
Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war  and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,  we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.
However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,  a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.
For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime  destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.
Aware of the devastation and the challenges,  I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,  calling for an inclusive and just transition  to democracy and national reconciliation.
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi  during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi --  almost 300 in Tripoli.
After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,  and with unique enthusiasm,  I started organizing workshops  on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women,  I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,  a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,  to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women  and to lobby for our right  for equal participation in building democracy and peace.
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,  an environment which was increasingly polarized,  an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress  in the first elections ever in 52 years.
However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,  and of the revolution as a whole,  was fading out --  for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.
One day we wake up to the news  of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.
On another day we wake up to the news  of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.
On another day we wake up to the news  of the assassination of army officers.
And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias  and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners  and their disrespect of the rule of law.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,  became more polarized  and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --  freedom, dignity, social justice --  that we first held.
Intolerance, exclusion and revenge  became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.
I am here today not at all to inspire you  with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.
I'm rather here today to confess  that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.
We did not prioritize right.
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates  bring peace and national reconciliation?
No, it didn't.
What is it, then?
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated  with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only,  but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building  more than it needed the elections,  which only reinforced polarization and division.
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine  more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a feminine discourse  that not only honors but also implements  mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,  inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya  needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
For peace has an alchemy,  and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation  between the feminine and masculine perspectives.
That's the real zipper.
And we need to establish that existentially  before we do so sociopolitically.
According to a Quranic verse  "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."
In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,  has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb --  symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity  from which the male and the female,  from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.
Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things."
Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."
May we all be granted a grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,  which has an equally disturbing answer.
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,  and the question I'm going to tackle  is the one question everyone always asks:  Why does she stay?
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her?
I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker  or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just one woman with a story to tell.
I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.
I had moved to New York City for my first job  as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.
I had my first apartment,  my first little green American Express card,  and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that I had this gun  loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head  by the man who I thought was my soulmate,  many, many times.
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth  held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me  more times than I can even remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,  a psychological trap disguised as love,  one that millions of women and even a few men  fall into every year.
It may even be your story.
I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,  an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies  including Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband  and we have three kids together.
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence  happens to everyone --  all races, all religions, all income and education levels.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks  domestic violence happens to women,  that it's a women's issue.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse  happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,  in other words, in families,  the last place we would want or expect to find violence,  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth  who would stay with a man who beats me,  but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22, and in the United States,  women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely  to be domestic violence victims  as women of other ages,  and over 500 women and girls this age  are killed every year by abusive partners,  boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing  about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.
I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.
He sat next to me on the New York City subway,  and he started chatting me up.
He told me two things.
One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,  and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting  was that he was smart and funny  and he looked like a farm boy.
He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks  and this wheat-blond hair,  and he seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,  was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.
He did this especially at the beginning  by idolizing me.
We started dating, and he loved everything about me,  that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,  that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.
He wanted to know everything about my family  and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.
Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,  in a way that no one else ever had.
Which is why that Ivy League degree  and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future  meant so much to him.
I didn't know that the first stage  in any domestic violence relationship  is to seduce and charm the victim.
I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,  and my dream job,  but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,  so I agreed, and I quit my job,  and Conor and I left Manhattan together.
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,  that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid  physical, financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern  is to introduce the threat of violence  and see how she reacts.
And here's where those guns come in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,  that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --  he bought three guns.
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.
He kept one under the pillows on our bed,  and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.
And he said that he needed those guns  because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.
He needed them to feel protected.
But those guns were really a message for me,  and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,  my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.
Conor first physically attacked me  five days before our wedding.
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.
Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,  and I put on my mother's wedding dress,  and I married him.
Despite what had happened,  I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,  because I loved him, and he loved me so much.
And he was very, very sorry.
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding  and by becoming a family with me.
It was an isolated incident,  and he was never going to hurt me again.
It happened twice more on the honeymoon.
The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach  and I got lost,  and he punched me in the side of my head so hard  that the other side of my head repeatedly hit  the driver's side window.
And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,  he got frustrated by traffic,  and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week  for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique  and alone in this situation.
One in three American women  experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,  and the CDC reports that 15 million children  are abused every year, 15 million.
So actually, I was in very good company.
Back to my question:  Why did I stay?
The answer is easy.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman  in love with a deeply troubled man,  and I was the only person on Earth  who could help Conor face his demons.
The other question everybody asks is,  why doesn't she just leave?
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.
To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,  because we victims know something you usually don't:  It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern  is kill her.
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders  happen after the victim has ended the relationship,  after she's gotten out,  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.
Other outcomes include long-term stalking,  even after the abuser remarries;  denial of financial resources;  and manipulation of the family court system  to terrify the victim and her children,  who are regularly forced by family court judges  to spend unsupervised time  with the man who beat their mother.
And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?
I was able to leave,  because of one final, sadistic beating  that broke through my denial.
I realized that the man who I loved so much  was going to kill me if I let him.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone:  the police, my neighbors,  my friends and family, total strangers,  and I'm here today because you all helped me.
We tend to stereotype victims  as grisly headlines,  self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question, "Why does she stay?"
is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"  as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men  intent upon destroying us.
But since publishing "Crazy Love,"  I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women  who also got out,  who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,  and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --  as employees, wives and mothers,  lives completely free of violence, like me.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim  and a typical domestic violence survivor.
I remarried a kind and gentle man,  and we have those three kids.
I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.
What I will never have again,  ever,  is a loaded gun held to my head  by someone who says that he loves me.
Right now, maybe you're thinking,  "Wow, this is fascinating,"  or, "Wow, how stupid was she,"  but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.
I promise you there are several people  listening to me right now  who are currently being abused  or who were abused as children  or who are abusers themselves.
Abuse could be affecting your daughter,  your sister, your best friend right now.
I was able to end my own crazy love story  by breaking the silence.
I'm still breaking the silence today.
It's my way of helping other victims,  and it's my final request of you.
Talk about what you heard here.
Abuse thrives only in silence.
You have the power to end domestic violence  simply by shining a spotlight on it.
We victims need everyone.
We need every one of you to understand  the secrets of domestic violence.
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it  with your children, your coworkers,  your friends and family.
Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people  with full futures.
Recognize the early signs of violence  and conscientiously intervene,  deescalate it, show victims a safe way out.
Together we can make our beds,  our dinner tables and our families  the safe and peaceful oases they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,  and for the last little while, I've been a model.
Actually, for 10 years.
And I feel like  there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now  because I should not have worn this dress.   So luckily, I brought an outfit change.
This is the first outfit change on the TED stage,  so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.
If some of the women were really horrified when I came out,  you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged  to be able to transform what you think of me  in a very brief 10 seconds.
Not everybody gets to do that.
These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
The worst part is putting this sweater over my head,  because that's when you'll all laugh at me,  so don't do anything while it's over my head.
All right.
So, why did I do that?
That was awkward.
Well --  Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.
Image is powerful,  but also, image is superficial.
I just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds.
And in this picture,  I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable,  and the photographer was telling me to arch my back  and put my hand in that guy's hair.
And of course, barring surgery,  or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,  there's very little that we can do to transform how we look,  and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable,  has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being fearless means being honest.
And I am on this stage because I am a model.
I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman,  and in my industry, we call that a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me,  but with an honest twist.
So the first question is, how do you become a model?
I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted," but that means nothing.
The real way that I became a model  is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy,  and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy.
Well, for the past few centuries  we have defined beauty not just as health and youth  and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire,  but also as tall, slender figures,  and femininity and white skin.
And this is a legacy that was built for me,  and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on.
And I know there are people in the audience  who are skeptical at this point,  and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like,  "Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."
And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007,  a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student  counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired,  and of the 677 models that were hired,  only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.
The next question people always ask is,  "Can I be a model when I grow up?"
And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that."
But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is,  "Why? You know? You can be anything.
You could be the President of the United States,  or the inventor of the next Internet,  or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,  which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one."
If, after this amazing list, they still are like,  "No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"  well, then I say, "Be my boss."
Because I'm not in charge of anything,  and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue  or the CEO of H&M, or the next Steven Meisel.
Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up  is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.
It's out of your control, and it's awesome,  and it's not a career path.
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge,  because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,  it can just be distilled right now.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, after you've gone to school,  and you have a rsum and you've done a few jobs,  you can't say anything anymore,  so if you say you want to be the President of the United States,  but your rsum reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years,"  people give you a funny look.
The next question is, "Do they retouch all the photos?"
And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos,  but that is only a small component of what's happening.
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took,  and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini,  and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl.
This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.
Here's me on the same day as this shoot.
My friend got to come.
Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.
Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.
And here's me today.
And I hope what you're seeing  is that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They are constructions,  and they are constructions by a group of professionals,  by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists  and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production,  and they build this. That's not me.
Okay, so the next question people always ask me is,  "Do you get free stuff?"
I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,  except for earlier,  but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life,  and that's what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge,  and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money  and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend  who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course,  we got pulled over,  and all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way.
And I got these free things because of how I look,  not who I am, and there are people paying a cost  for how they look and not who they are.
I live in New York, and last year,  of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked,  86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York,  so for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?"
but "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"
When I was researching this talk,  I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States,  53% don't like their bodies,  and that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17.
So, the last question people ask me is,  "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think the answer that they're looking for is,  "If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,  you will be so happy and fabulous."
And when we're backstage,  we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.
We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work  with creative, inspired, passionate people."
And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story,  because the thing that we never say on camera,  that I have never said on camera, is,  "I am insecure."
And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day.
And if you ever are wondering,  "If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?"
you just need to meet a group of models,  because they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,  and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression  when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.
If there's a takeaway to this talk,  I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging  the power of image in our perceived successes  and our perceived failures.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion  ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,  but today I want to share with you  the 15 most treasured photos of mine,  and I didn't take any of them.
There were no art directors, no stylists,  no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.
In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.
My story begins  when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,  and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter  on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,  so we decided to take the same picture.
Well you can see where this is going.
Approaching my daughter's third birthday,  my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York  and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?"
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.
You know, it's remarkable how universal  the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.
No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.
Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.
It's really become sacred to us.
This one was taken just weeks after 9/11,  and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day  in ways a five-year-old could understand.
So these photos are far more than proxies  for a single moment, or even a specific trip.
They're also ways for us to freeze time  for one week in October  and reflect on our times  and how we change from year to year,  and not just physically, but in every way.
Because while we take the same photo,  our perspectives change,  and she reaches new milestones,  and I get to see life through her eyes,  and how she interacts with and sees everything.
This very focused time we get to spend together  is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.
Recently, on one trip, we were walking,  and she stops dead in her tracks,  and she points to a red awning of the doll store  that she loved when she was little  on our earlier trips.
And she describes to me the feeling she felt  as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest  when she saw that place for the very first time  nine years earlier.
And now what she's looking at in New York  are colleges,  because she's determined to go to school in New York.
And it hit me: One of the most important things  we all make are memories.
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role  in consciously creating memories.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,  I'm not in many of the family photos.
I'm always the one taking the picture.
So I want to encourage everyone today  to get in the shot,  and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,  "Will you take our picture?"
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about  a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.
First of all, why do they have such a bad press?
They've also be associated with Disney     personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press        these are the attributes that they associated  the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.
I want to challenge that. Do you know why?
Because MPs  do not keep the environment clean.   MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.
They are hardly monogamous.    They are far from being extinct.   And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking.    So there's two types of vultures in this planet.
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found  in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,  and then the Old World vultures, where we have  16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing  a high risk of extinction.
So why are vultures important? First of all,  they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.
They're our natural garbage collectors.
They clean up carcasses right to the bone.
They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax  that would otherwise spread and cause  huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are  no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times  to decompose, and this has huge ramifications  for the spread of diseases.
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector  and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,  symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.
In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,  and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita  from the 10-headed demon Ravana.
In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important  sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places  to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,  so these vultures provide a natural disposal system.
So what is the problem with vultures?
We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,  of which six are highly threatened with extinction.
The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason  that they're getting poisoned is because there's  human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities  are using this poison to target predators,  and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,  four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,  which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,  and the reason is because they are falling prey  by consuming livestock that has been treated  with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.
This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,  and they have taken a stand.
Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread  in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,  and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb  of rabies. The number of cases of rabies  has increased tremendously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:  353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.
I am not against wind energy, but we need to work  with the governments, because wind turbines  do this to birds. They slice them in half.
They are bird-blending machines.
In West Africa, there's a horrific trade  of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.
So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research  on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology,  and see where they go.
We can see that they travel different countries, so  if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.
We need to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,  about the need from within to appreciate these  wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.
How can you help? You can become active,  make noise. You can write a letter to your government  and tell them that we need to focus on these very  misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time  to spread the word. Spread the word.
When you walk out of this room, you will be informed  about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,  to your neighbors about vultures.
They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said  he changed his mind because he watched them fly  effortlessly without energy in the skies.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer  without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --  my life -- has been shaped  by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.
From 1971 to 1977 --  I look young, but I'm not   --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,  in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO,  and every single project that we set up in Africa  failed.
And I was distraught.
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people  and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead, everything we touched we killed.
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,  "Ripples from the Zambezi,"  was a project where we Italians  decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia  in this absolutely magnificent valley  going down to the Zambezi River,  and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes  and zucchini and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest  in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,  and sometimes they would show up.   And we were amazed that the local people,  in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.
But instead of asking them how come they were not  growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here."   "Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato  would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,  "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,  overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river  and they ate everything.   And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"
And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."   "Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,  but then I saw what the Americans were doing,  what the English were doing, what the French were doing,  and after seeing what they were doing,  I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.
You should see the rubbish   --  You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed  on unsuspecting African people.
You want to read the book,  read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,  Zambian woman economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We Western donor countries have given the African continent  two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.
Just go and read her book.
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,  and there are only two ways we deal with people:  We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.
The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"  which means "father."
But they mean two different things.
Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture  as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture  as if they were my servants.
That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.
I was given a slap in the face reading a book,  "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,  above all in economic development, if people  do not wish to be helped, leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference  lay a stick on the floor, and said,  "Can we -- can you imagine a city  that is not neocolonial?"
I decided when I was 27 years old  to only respond to people,  and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,  where you never initiate anything,  you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant  of the local passion, the servant of local people  who have a dream to become a better person.
So what you do -- you shut up.
You never arrive in a community with any ideas,  and you sit with the local people.
We don't work from offices.
We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what we do, we become friends,  and we find out what that person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do it,  what are you going to do?
The passion that the person has for her own growth  is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth  is the most important thing.
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,  because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,  but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea:  Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community  to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,  listen to them? But not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There is a problem with community meetings.
Entrepreneurs never come,  and they never tell you, in a public meeting,  what they want to do with their own money,  what opportunity they have identified.
So planning has this blind spot.
The smartest people in your community you don't even know,  because they don't come to your public meetings.
What we do, we work one-on-one,  and to work one-on-one, you have to create  a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,  the family doctor of business, who sits with you  in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,  and helps you find the resources to transform your passion  into a way to make a living.
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,  trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit  that we arrive and tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on,  and the government came to see me to say,  "How can you do that?
How can you do  ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.
I shut up, and listen to them."   So     So the government says, "Do it again."   We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs  who are dying of solitude.
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,  died age 96, a few years ago.
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy  before becoming involved in business,  and this is what Peter Drucker says:  "Planning is actually incompatible  with an entrepreneurial society and economy."
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch  without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch  want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people  to come and talk to you.
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,  you have to be fantastic at helping them,  and then they will come, and they will come in droves.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,  the intelligence and the passion?
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.
So what I'm saying is that  entrepreneurship is where it's at.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --  nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --  and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.
What we have to look at is at how we  feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate  for seven billion people in a sustainable way.
The technologies do not exist to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology  for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!
Government? Forget about it!
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine  many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited  to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.
And in 1860, this group of people came together,  and they all speculated about what would happen  to the city of New York in 100 years,  and the conclusion was unanimous:  The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,  if the population keeps growing at this rate,  to move the population of New York around,  they would have needed six million horses,  and the manure created by six million horses  would be impossible to deal with.
They were already drowning in manure.   So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology  that is going to choke the life out of New York.
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,  in the United States of America, there were 1,001  car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.
The idea of finding a different technology  had absolutely taken over,  and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them confidentiality.
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.
Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,  passionate service to them.
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.
The smallest company, the biggest company,  has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:  The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,  you have to have fantastic marketing,  and you have to have tremendous financial management.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being  in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.
It doesn't exist.
This person has never been born.
We've done the research, and we have looked  at the 100 iconic companies of the world --  Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,  all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all the successful companies  in the world have in common, only one:  None were started by one person.
Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community  where we have facilitators who come from a small business background  sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies  who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman  who talks about this epic,  somebody who will say to you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"
"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"
We activate communities.
Thank you.
There are a lot of ways the people around us  can help improve our lives.
We don't bump into every neighbor,  so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,  though we do share the same public spaces.
So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more  with my neighbors in public space,  using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk.
And these projects came from questions I had, like:  How much are my neighbors paying for their apartments?
How can we lend and borrow more things,  without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time?
How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings,  and gain a better understanding of our landscape?
How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts,  so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?
Now, I live in New Orleans,  and I am in love with New Orleans.
My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees,  shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years,  and I trust a city that always makes way for music.
I feel like every time someone sneezes,  New Orleans has a parade.   The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world,  but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
I live near this house,  and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,  and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.
Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me.
And her death was sudden and unexpected.
And I thought about death a lot.
And ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had.
And ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now.
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.
I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day,  and forget what really matters to you.
So with help from old and new friends,  I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard,  and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence:  "Before I die, I want to ..."
So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk,  and share their personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment,  but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out,  and it kept growing.
And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.
"Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy."   "Before I die, I want to straddle the International Dateline."
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions."
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
"Before I die, I want to live off the grid."
"Before I die, I want to hold her one more time."
"Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry."
"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
So this neglected space became a constructive one,  and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up,  and they consoled me during my own tough times.
It's about knowing you're not alone;  it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways;  it's about making space for reflection and contemplation,  and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change.
I made this last year,  and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people  who wanted to make a wall with their community.
So, my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit,  and now walls have been made in countries around the world,  including Kazakhstan, South Africa,  Australia,  Argentina, and beyond.
Together, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be  if we're given the opportunity to have a voice,  and share more with one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have  are time, and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increasing distractions,  it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective,  and remember that life is brief and tender.
Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about,  or even think about,  but I've realized that preparing for death  is one of the most empowering things you can do.
Thinking about death clarifies your life.
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us,  as individuals and as a community,  and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories,  the people around us can not only help us make better places,  they can help us lead better lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have just one request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22,  tall and very handsome.
He's speechless, but he communicates joy  in a way that some of the best orators cannot.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.
He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:  He has never told a lie.
When he sings songs from our childhood,  attempting words that not even I could remember,  he reminds me of one thing:  how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful  the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.
He has the most impeccable memory.
He has a selective one, though.
He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,  but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,  conversations we had when he was four,  weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,  and Lady Gaga's birthday.
Don't they sound incredible?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit  into society's version of normal,  they're often bypassed and misunderstood.
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul  was that even though this was the case,  although they were not seen as ordinary,  this could only mean one thing:  that they were extraordinary --  autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"  it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,  learning and sometimes physical skills.
It manifests in each individual differently,  hence why Remi is so different from Sam.
And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person  is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of  the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,  there is no known cause or cure.
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,  but I cannot recall a day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came along,  and I was so excited that  I had a new being in my life.
And after a few months went by,  I realized that he was different.
He screamed a lot.
He didn't want to play like the other babies did,  and in fact, he didn't seem  very interested in me whatsoever.
Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,  and he found pleasure in the smallest things,  like lining up cars around the room  and staring at the washing machine  and eating anything that came in between.
And as he grew older, he grew more different,  and the differences became more obvious.
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration  and the never-ending hyperactivity  was something really unique:  a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world  without prejudice, a human who had never lied.
Extraordinary.
Now, I cannot deny that there have been  some challenging moments in my family,  moments where I've wished that they were just like me.
But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me  about individuality and communication and love,  and I realize that these are things that  I wouldn't want to change with normality.
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,  and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi  and to Sam  and to you,  it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not,  the differences that we have --  We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,  and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality  is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The chance for greatness, for progress and for change  dies the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a bit  of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,  to teach a communications class for engineering students.
And I was scared.   Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains  and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.
But as these conversations unfolded,  I experienced what Alice must have when she went down  that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations  with the students. I was amazed at the ideas  that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.
And I believe the key to opening that door  is great communication.
We desperately need great communication from our  scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones  that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy  to environment to health care, among others,  and if we don't know about it and understand it,  then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility  as non-scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists  and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that  to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy  and that your engineering is engaging.
First question to answer for us: so what?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,  but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones  because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say  "space and time," which is so much more accessible to us?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything  as simple as possible, but no simpler.
You can clearly communicate your science  without compromising the ideas.
A few things to consider are having examples, stories  and analogies. Those are ways to engage  and excite us about your content.
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points?   What do bullets do? Bullets kill,  and they will kill your presentation.
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much  on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is  much more effective. It's showing that the special structure  of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired  the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence  that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,  and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses  and create a deeper sense of understanding  of what's being described.
So I think these are just a few keys that can help  the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland  that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved  this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me.   Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the whole of  the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster."
Just because it sounds so good.
And what snollygoster means is  "a dishonest politician."
Although there was a 19th-century  newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said,  "A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office  regardless of party, platform or principle,  and who, when he wins,  gets there by the sheer force  of monumental talknophical assumnancy."
Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is.
Something to do with words, I assume.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics,  and all politicians know they have to try and control language.
It wasn't until, for example, 1771  that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report  the exact words that were said in the debating chamber.
And this was actually all down to the bravery  of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,  who took on Parliament.
And he was thrown into the Tower of London  and imprisoned,  but he was brave enough,  he was brave enough to take them on,  and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won.
And it was only a few years later  that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  "as bold as brass."
Most people think that's down to the metal.
It's not. It's down to a campaigner  for the freedom of the press.
But to really show you how  words and politics interact,  I want to take you back to the United States of America,  just after they'd achieved independence.
And they had to face the question  of what to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
What do you call the leader of a republican country?
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.
And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,  which might have made it.
I mean, some people wanted him to be called  Chief Magistrate Washington,  and other people, His Highness George Washington,  and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington.
Not that catchy.
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They thought it was tried and tested.
And they weren't even being monarchical there,  they had the idea that you could be elected King  for a fixed term.
And, you know, it could have worked.
And everybody got insanely bored, actually,  because this debate went on for three weeks.
I read a diary of this poor senator,  who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject."
And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that  the House of Representatives were against the Senate.
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington  to get drunk on power.
They didn't want to call him King  in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas.
So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,  most pathetic title that they could think of.
And that title was "President."
President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before,  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.
It was like the foreman of the jury.
And it didn't have much more grandeur  than the term "foreman" or "overseer."
There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils  and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title.
And that's why the Senate objected to it.
They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.
And who's going to take him seriously  if he's got a silly little title  like President of the United States of America?
And after three weeks of debate, in the end  the Senate did not cave in.
Now you can learn three interesting things from this.
First of all -- and this is my favorite --  is that so far as I've ever been able to find out,  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action.
Second thing you can learn is that  when a government says that this is a temporary measure --   --  you can still be waiting 223 years later.
But the third thing you can learn,  and this is the really important one,  this is the point I want to leave you on,  is that the title, President of the United States of America,  doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?
Something to do with the slightly over 5,000  nuclear warheads he has at his disposal  and the largest economy in the world  and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.
Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.
And so the Senate won in the end.
They got their title of respectability.
And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity --  well, it was a singularity back then.
But now, do you know how many nations have a president?
All because they want to sound like  the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.
And so, in the end, the Senate won  and the House of Representatives lost,  because nobody's going to feel that humble  when they're told that they are now  the President of the United States of America.
And that's the important lesson I think you can take away,  and the one I want to leave you with.
Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality  and control reality, but in fact,  reality changes words far more  than words can ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.
The air is thick with heat and dust,  and it's hard to breathe.
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me  in the darkness, but I can't see much else.
I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft  is this cacophony of men coughing,  and stone being broken with primitive tools.
Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight  tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,  and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs  holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole  dropping hundreds of feet into the earth.
When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner  I had met days before who had lost his grip  and fell countless feet down that shaft.
As I stand talking to you today,  these men are still deep in that hole,  risking their lives without payment or compensation,  and often dying.
I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,  but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.
For the last 28 years, I've been documenting  indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries  on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor  of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,  I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO  dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and really,  I started learning about slavery,  for I had certainly known it existed in the world,  but not to such a degree.
After we finished talking, I felt so horrible  and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge  of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,  if I don't know, how many other people don't know?
It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,  I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director  of Free the Slaves and offer them my help.
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery.
Oddly, I had been to many of these places before.
Some I even considered like my second home.
But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than  27 million people enslaved in the world today.
That's double the amount of people taken from Africa  during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.
A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave  cost about three times the annual salary  of an American worker.
That equates to about $50,000 in today's money.
Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations  over a debt as small as $18.
Astonishingly, slavery generates profits  of more than $13 billion worldwide each year.
Many have been tricked by false promises  of a good education, a better job, only to find  that they're forced to work without pay  under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.
Today's slavery is about commerce,  so the goods that enslaved people produce have value,  but the people producing them are disposable.
Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,  and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.
In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.
This strange and awesome sight was like  walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,  men, women, children, entire families in fact,  were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,  while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,  up to 18 at a time, and carrying them  from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,  they work silently, doing this task over and over  for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,  and the severe dehydration made urinating  pretty much inconsequential.
So pervasive was the heat and the dust  that my camera became too hot to even touch  and ceased working.
Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser  to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner  to revive it, and as I sat there,  I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment  than these people.
Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,  but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me  and he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays  are very dangerous in a place like this,  not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could get them in a worse situation  than they were already in.
I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work  within the system for their liberation,  and I trusted that they would.
As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home  to really feel my heartbreak.
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone  for miles down mountainous terrain  to trucks waiting at roads below.
The big sheets of slate were heavier  than the children carrying them,  and the kids hoisted them from their heads  using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope  and torn cloth.
It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.
How can we affect something so insidious,  yet so pervasive?
Some don't even know they're enslaved,  people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,  because this has been the case all their lives.
They have nothing to compare it to.
When these villagers claimed their freedom,  the slaveholders burned down all of their houses.
Sex trafficking is what we often think of  when we hear the word slavery,  and because of this worldwide awareness,  I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely  within this particular industry.
In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had  previously been sex slaves themselves.
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs  that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.
This wasn't a brothel, per se.
It was more like a restaurant.
Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,  are venues for forced prostitution.
Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,  women, along with young girls and boys,  some as young as seven years old,  are forced to entertain the clients,  encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each cubicle is dark and dingy,  identified with a painted number on the wall,  and partitioned by plywood and a curtain.
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse  at the hands of their customers.
Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling  this quick, hot fear, and in that instant,  I could only imagine what it must be like  to be trapped in that hell.
I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.
There were no back doors.
There were no windows large enough to climb through.
These people have no escape at all,  and as we take in such a difficult subject,  it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,  occurs in our own backyard as well.
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,  in restaurants, in domestic servitude,  and the list can go on.
Recently, the New York Times reported that  between 100,000 and 300,000 American children  are sold into sex slavery every year.
It's all around us. We just don't see it.
The textile industry is another one we often think of  when we hear about slave labor.
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved  in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait.
The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue  and red hands are his sons.
They mix dye in these big barrels,  and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,  but the dye is toxic.
My interpreter told me their stories.
"We have no freedom," they said.
"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house  someday and go someplace else  where we actually get paid for our dyeing."
It's estimated that more than 4,000 children  are enslaved on Lake Volta,  the largest man-made lake in the world.
When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,  two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?
Wrong. They were all enslaved.
Children are taken from their families  and trafficked and vanished,  and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats  on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.
This young child is eight years old.
He was trembling when our boat approached,  frightened it would run over his tiny canoe.
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water.
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta  often catch the fishing nets, and weary,  frightened children are thrown into the water  to untether the lines.
Many of them drown.
For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work  on the lake.
Terrified of his master, he will not run away,  and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,  he passes that down to the younger slaves  that he manages.
I met these boys at five in the morning,  when they were hauling in the last of their nets,  but they had been working since 1 a.m.
in the cold, windy night.
And it's important to note that these nets weigh  more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kofi.
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village.
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves  rehabilitates victims of slavery.
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility.
Who will he become because someone took a stand  and made a difference in his life?
Driving down a road in Ghana  with partners of Free the Slaves,  a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up  to our cruiser and tapped on the window.
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.
At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,  and told the driver to quickly leave.
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,  and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go."
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines  blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,  found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,  so I hoisted the photo gear above my head  as we descended into these waters up to my chest.
After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail  abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us  was a mass of holes  that could fit into the size of a football field,  and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.
Many women had children strapped to their backs  while they were panning for gold,  wading in water poisoned by mercury.
Mercury is used in the extraction process.
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft  in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet  from their own sweat.
I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,  for many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out  heavy bags of stone that later will be transported  to another area, where the stone will be pounded  so that they can extract the gold.
At first glance, the pounding site seems full  of powerful men, but when we look closer,  we see some less fortunate working on the fringes,  and children too.
All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person  will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis  and mercury poisoning in just a few years.
This is Manuru. When his father died,  his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.
When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,  which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.
When I met him, he had been working in the mines  for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here  is actually from a mining accident,  one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.
On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,  yet he's still forced to work day in and day out  in that mine shaft.
Even still, he has a dream that he will become free  and become educated with the help of local activists  like Free the Slaves,  and it's this sort of determination,  in the face of unimaginable odds,  that fills me with complete awe.
I want to shine a light on slavery.
They knew their image would be seen  by you out in the world.
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness  to them, and that we will do whatever we can  to help make a difference in their lives.
I truly believe, if we can see one another  as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult  to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of issues. They are of people,  real people, like you and me, all deserving  of the same rights, dignity and respect  in their lives.
There is not a day that goes by that I don't think  of these many beautiful, mistreated people  I've had the tremendous honor of meeting.
I hope that these images awaken a force  in those who view them, people like you,  and I hope that force will ignite a fire,  and that fire will shine a light on slavery,  for without that light, the beast of bondage  can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
So, well, I do applied math,  and this is a peculiar problem  for anyone who does applied math, is that  we are like management consultants.
No one knows what the hell we do.
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today  to try and explain to you what I do.
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers  you will see later on.
Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise  and a high level of skill,  and probably a level of initial suitability  that may well have a genetic component to it.
Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease  gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was  a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide  who have the disease, and they have to live with  incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity  and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,  so what we need are objective tools  to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progression objectively,  and ultimately, the only way we're going to know  when we actually have a cure is when we have  an objective measure that can answer that for sure.
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease  and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,  so there's no simple blood test that you can do,  and the best that we have is like  this 20-minute neurologist test.
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,  and that means that, outside the clinical trials,  it's just never done. It's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,  and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?
No expensive staff time required.
Takes about $300, by the way,  in the neurologist's clinic to do it.
So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way  in which we can try to achieve this,  because, you see, in one sense, at least,  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs  when we make sounds, and we all actually  have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can actually track  the vocal fold position as it vibrates,  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,  so too are the vocal organs.
So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of  irregular vocal fold tremor.
We see all the same symptoms.
We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy  after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against  expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,  voice-based tests are non-expert.
That means they can be self-administered.
They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.
When something becomes ultra-low cost,  it becomes massively scalable.
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,  and we can make population-scale screening  feasible for the first time.
We have the opportunity to start to search  for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.
So, taking the first steps towards this today,  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming  to record a very large number of voices worldwide  to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters  of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,  and leave recordings, a few cents each,  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit  six percent of our target just in eight hours.
Thank you.     Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,  let's say, 10,000 people,  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to get out of those samples?
Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,  during the call you have to indicate whether or not  you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.
ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.
But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected  from all different circumstances, and it's getting it  in different circumstances that matter because then  we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,  and looking for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?
ML: It's much better than that.
Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,  because he's done some fantastic work,  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,  which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.
TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.
ML: Absolutely.
TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.
ML: Thanks, Tom.
Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher  based in New York City.
We're pale, gray creatures.
We hide in dark, windowless rooms,  and generally avoid sunlight.
We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,  and the impossible possible,  and we get criticized in the press all the time,  but some of us are actually talented artists  with years of experience  and a real appreciation for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest  of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.
Soon after, an organization I volunteer with,  All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,  working as part of the response efforts.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,  knew we couldn't just sit at home,  so I decided to join them for three weeks.
On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of funato.
It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,  about 50,000 people,  one of the first that was hit by the wave.
The waters here have been recorded at reaching  over 24 meters in height,  and traveled over two miles inland.
As you can imagine, the town had been devastated.
We pulled debris from canals and ditches.
We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes  ready for renovation and rehabilitation.
We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses  from the local fish processing plant.
We got dirty, and we loved it.
For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike  had been finding similar things.
They'd been finding photos and photo albums  and cameras and SD cards.
And everyone was doing the same.
They were collecting them up, and handing them in to  various places around the different towns for safekeeping.
Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized  that these photos were such a huge part  of the personal loss these people had felt.
As they had run from the wave, and for their lives,  absolutely everything they had,  everything had to be left behind.
At the end of my first week there, I found myself  helping out in an evacuation center in the town.
I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,  the huge giant bathtubs.
This happened to also be a place in the town where  the evacuation center was collecting the photos.
This is where people were handing them in,  and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me  to help them start hand-cleaning them.
Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring,  and I've always heard about thinking outside the box,  but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box  that something happened.
As I looked through the photos, there were some  were over a hundred years old,  some still in the envelope from the processing lab,  I couldn't help but think as a retoucher  that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,  and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook  and asked a few of them, and by morning  the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,  I knew we had to give it a go.
So we started retouching photos.
This was the very first.
Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused  that discoloration on the girl's face  had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.
Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look  like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic  as having the photo damaged.
Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,  and more retouchers were needed,  and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,  and within five days, 80 people wanted to help  from 12 different countries.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people  wanting to join in.
Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out  to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,  further north to a town called Yamada.
Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment  in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,  where people were reclaiming their photos.
The time it took, however, to get it back  is a completely different story,  and it depended obviously on the damage involved.
It could take an hour. It could take weeks.
It could take months.
The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,  or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color  and detail that the water hadn't damaged.
It was very time-consuming.
Now, all these photos had been damaged by water,  submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,  in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time  is going to continue to damage them,  so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.
We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,  dry and reclaimed.
Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.
We had an amazing local woman who guided us.
It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.
As my team leader Wynne once said,  it's like doing a tattoo on someone.
You don't get a chance to mess it up.
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky,  as far as the photos go.
She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped  when she realized she was doing more damage.
She also had duplicates.
Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise  would have been completely impossible to fix,  we could just put them together in one good photo,  and remake the whole photo.
When she collected the photos from us,  she shared a bit of her story with us.
Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues  at a local fire department in the debris  a long way from where the home had once stood,  and they'd recognized him.
The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge  of making sure the tsunami gates were closed.
He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded.
Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys  were both at school, separate schools.
One of them got caught up in the water.
It took her a week to find them all again  and find out that they had all survived.
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be  her youngest son's 14th birthday.
For her, despite all of this, those photos  were the perfect gift back to him,  something he could look at again, something he remembered from before  that wasn't still scarred from that day in March  when absolutely everything else in his life had changed  or been destroyed.
After six months in Japan,  1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,  hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean  over 135,000 photographs,  the large majority     a large majority of which did actually find their home again,  importantly.
Over five hundred volunteers around the globe  helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,  fully restored and retouched.
During this time, we hadn't really spent more than  about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,  most of which was printer inks.
We take photos constantly.
A photo is a reminder of someone or something,  a place, a relationship, a loved one.
They're our memory-keepers and our histories,  the last thing we would grab  and the first thing you'd go back to look for.
That's all this project was about,  about restoring those little bits of humanity,  giving someone that connection back.
When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,  it makes a huge difference  in the lives of the person receiving it.
The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers.
For some of them, it's given them a connection  to something bigger, giving something back,  using their talents on something  other than skinny models and perfect skin.
I would like to conclude by reading an email  I got from one of them, Cindy,  the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.
"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals  and the stories represented in the images.
One in particular, a photo of women of all ages,  from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,  struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,  my grandmother and mother, myself,  and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.
Across the globe, throughout the ages,  our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?"
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity  with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,  and exposure just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster  and see the world not at a million or a billion,  but one trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of photography,  femto-photography,  a new imaging technique so fast  that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners,  beyond line of sight,  or see inside our body without an x-ray,  and really challenge what we mean by a camera.
Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off  in one trillionth of a second --  which is several femtoseconds --  I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide.
And that packet of photons, that bullet,  will travel at the speed of light,  and again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.
Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons  and fire into this bottle,  how will those photons shatter into this bottle?
How does light look in slow motion?
[Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow] Now, the whole event --    Now remember, the whole event is effectively taking place  in less than a nanosecond --  that's how much time it takes for light to travel.
But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion,  so you can see the light in motion.
But Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.   Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,  so let me break this down and show you what's going on.
So the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,  with a packet of photons that start traveling through  and that start scattering inside.
Some of the light leaks, goes on the table,  and you start seeing these ripples of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the cap  and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air  and it's bouncing around inside.
Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,  and because of the reflections at the top,  you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,  the reflections are focused.
Now, if you take an ordinary bullet  and let it go the same distance and slow down the video --  again, by a factor of 10 billion --  do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?
A day, a week? Actually, a whole year.
It'll be a very boring movie --   of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.
And what about some still-life photography?
You can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table,  the tomato and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water.
I thought: this is how nature paints a photo,  one femto frame at a time,  but of course our eye sees an integral composite.
But if you look at this tomato one more time,  you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,  it continues to glow.
It doesn't become dark. Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe,  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second.
So in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,  you might be able to go to a supermarket  and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.
So how did my team at MIT create this camera?
Now, as photographers, you know,  if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,  so you're going to get hardly any light.
So what we do is we send that bullet --  that packet of photons -- millions of times,  and record again and again with very clever synchronization,  and from the gigabytes of data,  we computationally weave together  to create those femto-videos I showed you.
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways.
So, Superman can fly.
Some other heroes can become invisible.
But what about a new power for a future superhero:  To see around corners.
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door,  it's going to bounce, go inside the room,  some of that is going to reflect back on the door,  and then back to the camera.
And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.
And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it.
On the left, you see our femto-camera.
There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,  and we're going to bounce light off the door.
So after our paper was published in Nature Communications,  and they created this animation.
And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,  but most interestingly,  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.
And because we have a camera that can run so fast --  our femto-camera -- it has some unique abilities.
It has very good time resolution,  and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,  but also to the hidden objects,  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.
By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,  which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.
But then we will take a lot of such pictures,  dozens of such pictures, put them together,  and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,  and from that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in full 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
Now, we have some ways to go  before we take this outside the lab on the road,  but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions  with what's around the bend.
Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions  by looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,  and also for cardioscopes.
But of course, because of tissue and blood,  this is quite challenging, so this is really a call for scientists  to start thinking about femto-photography  as really a new imaging modality  to solve the next generation of health-imaging problems.
Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,  science became art -- an art of ultra-fast photography.
that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time,  are not just for scientific imaging.
But we can also do a new form of computational photography,  with time-lapse and color coding.
And we look at those ripples. Remember:  The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second.
But there's also something funny going on here.
When you look at the ripples under the cap,  the ripples are moving away from us.
The ripples should be moving towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light,  we have strange effects,  and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order at which events take place in the world  appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order.
So by applying the corresponding space and time warp,  we can correct for this distortion.
It's about time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change your life,  and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone,  you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone,  you can tweet a message  and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a mobile phone,  you can record a song, load it up to  SoundCloud and become famous.
All this is possible with your mobile phone.
I'm a child of 1984,  and I live in the city of Berlin.
Let's go back to that time, to this city.
Here you can see  how hundreds of thousands of people  stood up and protested for change.
This is autumn 1989,  and imagine that all those people standing up  and protesting for change had a  mobile phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?
Hold it up.
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,  and how it changed my life.
And I will talk about this.
These are 35,830 lines of information.
Raw data.
And why are these informations there?
Because in the summer of 2006,  the E.U. Commission tabled a directive.
This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.
This directive says that each phone company in Europe,  each Internet service company all over Europe,  has to store a wide range of information about the users.
Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email?
Who sends whom a text message?
And if you use your mobile phone, where you are.
All this information is stored for at least six months,  up to two years by your phone company  or your Internet service provider.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said,  "We don't want this."
They said, we don't want this data retention.
We want self-determination in the digital age,  and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies  have to store all this information about us.
They were lawyers, journalists, priests,  they all said: "We don't want this."
And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people  went out on the streets of Berlin and said,  "Freedom, not fear."
And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also ask myself, does it really work?
Can they really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my mobile phone?
So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,  which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,  and I asked them, please,  send me all the information you have stored about me.
And I asked them once, and I asked them again,  and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.
But then I said, I want to have this information,  because this is my life you are protocoling.
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them,  because I wanted to have this information.
But Deutsche Telekom said, no,  we will not give you this information.
So at the end, I had a settlement with them.
I'll put down the lawsuit  and they will send me all the information I ask for.
Because in the mean time,  the German Constitutional Court ruled  that the implementation of this E.U. directive  into German law was unconstitutional.
So I got this ugly brown envelope  with a C.D. inside.
And on the C.D., this was on.
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.
At first I saw it, and I said, okay,  it's a huge file. Okay.
But then after a while I realized,  this is my life.
This is six months of my life,  into this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?
Because you can see where I am,  where I sleep at night,  what I am doing.
But then I said, I want to go out with this information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean.
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out,  you can wind back and fast forward.
You can see every step I take.
And you can even see  how I go from Frankfurt by train  to Cologne, and how often I call in between.
All this is possible with this information.
That's a little bit scary.
But it is not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,  and we talk to each other a couple of times.
And then there are some friends calling me,  and they call each other.
And after a while you are calling you,  and you are calling you, and you have this great  communication network.
But you can see how your people are communicating with each other,  what times they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.
If you have access to this information,  you can see what your society is doing.
If you have access to this information,  you can control your society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is a blueprint how to survey your society,  because you know who talks to whom,  who sends whom an email, all this is possible  if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months  in Europe, up to two years.
Like I said at the beginning,  imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin  in autumn of 1989  had a mobile phone in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,  and if the Stasi would have known  who are the leaders behind it,  this may never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.
And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Because today, state agencies and companies  want to store as much information as they can get about us,  online and offline.
They want to have the possibility to track our lives,  and they want to store them for all time.
But self-determination and living in the digital age  is no contradiction.
But you have to fight for your self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So, when you go home,  tell your friends  that privacy is a value of the 21st century,  and it's not outdated.
When you go home, tell your representative  only because companies and state agencies have the possibility  to store certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me,  ask your phone company what information they store about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,  let it be a reminder to you  that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.
Not good enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?
(Loud cheering)  My name is Maysoon Zayid,  and I am not drunk,  but the doctor who delivered me was.
He cut my mom six different times  in six different directions,  suffocating poor little me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy,  which means I shake all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting.
I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
CP is not genetic.
It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,  and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins,  which they are.
It only happens from accidents,  like what happened to me on my birth day.
Now, I must warn you,  I'm not inspirational.
And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me,  because at some point in your life,  you have dreamt of being disabled.
Come on a journey with me.
It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,  you're driving around in circles looking for parking,  and what do you see?
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.
And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"
Also, I've got to tell you,  I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.
If there was an Oppression Olympics,  I would win the gold medal.
I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled,  and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.
Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.
I have always loved the fact  that my hood and my affliction share the same initials.
I also love the fact  that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.
A lot of people with CP don't walk,  but my parents didn't believe in "can't."
My father's mantra was,  "You can do it, yes you can can."
So, if my three older sisters were mopping,  I was mopping.
If my three older sisters went to public school,  my parents would sue the school system  and guarantee that I went too,  and if we didn't all get A's,  we all got my mother's slipper.
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old  by placing my heels on his feet  and just walking.
Another tactic that he used  is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.
My inner stripper was very strong.
Yeah. No, by the first day of kindergarten,  I was walking like a champ  who had been punched one too many times.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town,  and they were all my family.
Now there are 20 Arabs in town,  and they are still all my family.   I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11  and before politicians thought it was appropriate  to use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
They did, however, seem very concerned  that I would starve to death during Ramadan.
I would explain to them that I have enough fat  to live off of for three whole months,  so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.
I have tap-danced on Broadway.
Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.   My parents couldn't afford physical therapy,  so they sent me to dancing school.
I learned how to dance in heels,  which means I can walk in heels.
And I'm from Jersey,  and we are really concerned with being chic,  so if my friends wore heels, so did I.
And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations  on the Jersey Shore, I did not.
I spent my summers in a war zone,  because my parents were afraid  that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer,  we'd grow up to be Madonna.
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me,  so I drank deer's milk,  I had hot cups on my back,  I was dunked in the Dead Sea,  and I remember the water burning my eyes  and thinking, "It's working! It's working!"
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
I have to tell you, it's very boring,  but before I did yoga,  I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.
And now I can stand on my head.
My parents reinforced this notion  that I could do anything,  that no dream was impossible,  and my dream was to be  on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."
I went to college during affirmative action  and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,  Arizona State University,  because I fit every single quota.
I was like the pet lemur of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework,  I got A's in all of my classes,  A's in all of their classes.
Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie,"  my professors would weep.
But I never got cast.
Finally, my senior year,  ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."
It's a play about a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I start shouting from the rooftops,  "I'm finally going to get a part!
I have cerebral palsy!
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"
I didn't get the part.   Sherry Brown got the part.
I went racing to the head of the theater department  crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat,  to ask her why,  and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.
I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts,  neither can the character."
This was a part that I was literally born to play  they gave it to a non-palsy actress.
College was imitating life.
Hollywood has a sordid history  of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.
Upon graduating, I moved back home,  and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.
My dream was coming true.
And I knew that I would be promoted  from "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.
But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture  that you could only recognize from the back of my head,  and it became clear to me  that casting directors  didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,  Roseanne Barr, Ellen,  and all of these women had one thing in common:  they were comedians.
So I became a comic.
My first gig was driving famous comics  from New York City to shows in New Jersey,  and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove  when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike  with a chick with CP driving him.
I've performed in clubs all over America,  and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East,  uncensored and uncovered.
Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.
I never like to claim first,  but I do know that they never heard  that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny,  and they find us hysterical.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father  Dean Obeidallah and I started  the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival,  now in its 10th year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media,  while also reminding casting directors  that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.
Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier  than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.
My big break came in 2010.
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show  "Countdown with Keith Olbermann."
I walked in looking like I was going to the prom,  and they shuffle me into a studio  and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.
So I looked at the stage manager  and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"
And she looked at me and she went,  "Five, four, three, two ..."
And we were live, right?
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk  so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment,  and when the interview was over, I was livid.
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it,  and I knew I would never get invited back.
But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back,  he made me a full-time contributor,  and he taped down my chair.
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann  was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.
People say children are cruel,  but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.
Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.
I would look at clips online and see comments like,  "Yo, why's she tweakin'?"
"Yo, is she retarded?"
And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.
What does she suffer from?
We should really pray for her."
One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits:  screenwriter, comedian, palsy.
Disability is as visual as race.
If a wheelchair user can't play Beyonc,  then Beyonc can't play a wheelchair user.
The disabled are the largest   Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world,  and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,  but I am here in front of you.
However, if I grew up with social media,  I don't think I would be.
I hope that together,  we can create more positive images  of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Perhaps if there were more positive images,  it would foster less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.
I got to walk the red carpet  flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci  and the iconic Loreen Arbus.
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler  and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.
I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey  at the 2008 DNC.
And I founded Maysoon's Kids,  a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children  a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.
(Applause ends)  It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live,  and I dedicate this talk to his memory.
Allah yerhamak yaba.
My name is Maysoon Zayid,  and if I can can, you can can.
I would like to talk to you about a story  about a small town kid.
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
His village is near Mogadishu.
Drought drives the small village into poverty  and to the brink of starvation.
With nothing left for him there,  he leaves for the big city,  in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
When he arrives, there are no opportunities,  no jobs, no way forward.
He ends up living in a tent city  on the outskirts of Mogadishu.
Maybe a year passes, nothing.
One day, he's approached by a gentleman  who offers to take him to lunch,  then to dinner, to breakfast.
He meets this dynamic group of people,  and they give him a break.
He's given a bit of money  to buy himself some new clothes,  money to send back home to his family.
He is introduced to this young woman.
He eventually gets married.
He starts this new life.
He has a purpose in life.
One beautiful day in Mogadishu,  under an azure blue sky,  a car bomb goes off.
That small town kid with the big city dreams  was the suicide bomber,  and that dynamic group of people  were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization  linked to al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a small town kid  just trying to make it big in the city  end up with him blowing himself up?
He was waiting.
He was waiting for an opportunity,  waiting to begin his future,  waiting for a way forward,  and this was the first thing that came along.
This was the first thing that pulled him out  of what we call waithood.
And his story repeats itself  in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the disenfranchised,  unemployed urban youth  who sparks riots in Johannesburg,  sparks riots in London,  who reaches out for something other than waithood.
For young people, the promise of the city,  the big city dream is that of opportunity,  of jobs, of wealth,  but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities  will be under the age of 18.
If we do not include young people  in the growth of our cities,  if we do not provide them opportunities,  the story of waithood,  the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,  will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,  70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
70 percent don't work,  don't go to school.
They pretty much do nothing.
I went back to Mogadishu last month,  and I went to visit Madina Hospital,  the hospital I was born in.
I remember standing in front of that  bullet-ridden hospital thinking,  what if I had never left?
What if I had been forced  into that same state of waithood?
Would I have become a terrorist?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
My reason for being in Mogadishu that month  was actually to host  a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions  to the biggest challenges facing their city.
One of the young men in the room was Aden.
He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.
There were no jobs, no opportunities.
I remember him telling me,  because he was a college graduate,  unemployed, frustrated,  that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab  and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They sought people like him out.
But his story takes a different route.
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier  to getting from point A to point B are the roads.
Twenty-three years of civil war  have completely destroyed the road system,  and a motorbike can be the easiest way  to get around.
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.
He started a motorbike company.
He began renting out motorbikes  to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
He bought 10 bikes, with the help  of family and friends,  and his dream is to eventually expand  to several hundred within the next three years.
How is this story different?
What makes his story different?
I believe it is his ability to identify  and seize a new opportunity.
It's entrepreneurship,  and I believe entrepreneurship can be  the most powerful tool against waithood.
It empowers young people  to be the creators of the very economic opportunities  they are so desperately seeking.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man  who attended one of my meetings,  Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
He was helping me train some of the young people  at the summit in entrepreneurship  and how to be innovative  and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen  in over 22 years,  and until recently, until Mohamed came along,  if you wanted flowers at your wedding,  you used plastic bouquets  shipped from abroad.
If you asked someone,  "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"
for many who grew up under civil war,  the answer would be, "Never."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a landscaping and design floral company.
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,  and started growing tulips and lilies,  which he said could survive  the harsh Mogadishu climate.
And he began delivering flowers to weddings,  creating gardens at homes  and businesses around the city,  and he's now working on creating  Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public park in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a space where families,  young people, can come together,  and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
And he doesn't grow roses because  they use too much water, by the way.
So the first step is to inspire young people,  and in that room, Mohamed's presence  had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
They had never really thought about starting up a business.
They've thought about working for an NGO,  working for the government,  but his story, his innovation,  really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city  as a place of opportunity.
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs,  that they could be change makers.
By the end of the day, they were coming up  with innovative solutions  to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions  to local problems.
So inspiring young people  and creating a culture of entrepreneurship  is a really great step,  but young people need capital  to make their ideas a reality.
They need expertise and mentorship  to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
Connect young people with the resources they need,  provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation,  and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just  starting up a business.
It's about creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I believe he is selling hope.
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,  when it's created, will actually transform  the way people see their city.
Aden hired street kids to help rent out  and maintain those bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape  the paralysis of waithood.
These young entrepreneurs are having  a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is,  turn youth into entrepreneurs,  incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,  and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks  than of car bombs and waithood.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old  on a camping trip with my dad  in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area  in the northern part of New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was sparkling.
The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,  and if it weren't for the path we were following,  we could almost pretend we were  the first human beings to ever walk that land.
We got to our campsite.
It was a lean-to on a bluff  looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,  when I discovered a horror.
Behind the lean-to was a dump,  maybe 40 feet square  with rotting apple cores  and balled-up aluminum foil,  and a dead sneaker.
And I was astonished,  I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
The campers who were too lazy  to take out what they had brought in,  who did they think would clean up after them?
That question stayed with me,  and it simplified a little.
Who cleans up after us?
However you configure  or wherever you place the us,  who cleans up after us in Istanbul?
Who cleans up after us in Rio  or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York,  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,  to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage  and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who takes the job.
What's it like to wear the uniform  and bear that burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I rode in the trucks and walked the routes  and interviewed people in offices and facilities  all over the city,  and I learned a lot,  but I was still an outsider.
I needed to go deeper.
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege  and an amazing education.
Everyone asks about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,  and on days when it is really bad,  you get used to it rather quickly.
The weight takes a long time to get used to.
I knew people who were several years on the job  whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden  of bearing on your body  tons of trash every week.
Then there's the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous  occupations in the country,  and I learned why.
You're in and out of traffic all day,  and it's zooming around you.
It just wants to get past you, so it's often  the motorist is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards  that often fly back out of the truck  and do terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
When you step off the curb  and you see a city from behind a truck,  you come to understand that trash  is like a force of nature unto itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And then there's the stigma.
I find the stigma especially ironic,  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers  are the most important labor force  on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first guardians of public health.
If they're not taking away trash  efficiently and effectively every day,  it starts to spill out of its containments,  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us  in very real ways.
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries  burst forth again and start to harm us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't throw out the old stuff,  we have no room for the new stuff,  so then the engines of the economy  start to sputter when consumption is compromised.
I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
And then there's what I call  our average, necessary quotidian velocity.
By that I simply mean  how fast we're used to moving  in the contemporary day and age.
We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around  our coffee cup, our shopping bag,  our bottle of water.
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,  because we know there's a workforce  on the other side that's going to take it all away.
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways  to think about sanitation that will perhaps help  ameliorate the stigma  and bring them into this conversation  of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.
Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.
They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.
They wear a uniform in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work lets us do our work.
They are almost a form of reassurance.
The flow that they maintain  keeps us safe from ourselves,  from our own dross, our cast-offs,  and that flow must be maintained always  no matter what.
On the day after September 11 in 2001,  I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs  and there was a man doing his paper recycling route  like he did every Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him for doing his work  on that day of all days,  but I started to cry.
And he looked at me,  and he just nodded, and he said,  "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
It was a little while later that I started  my research with sanitation,  and I met that man again.
His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,  and we became good friends.
I want to believe that Paulie was right.
We are going to be okay.
But in our effort to reconfigure  how we as a species exist on this planet,  we must include and take account of  all the costs, including the very real human cost  of the labor.
Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of your days,  in the flow of your lives,  next time you see someone whose job is  to clean up after you,  take a moment to acknowledge them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of  both thinking about our community life  being part of the environment  where architecture grows from the natural  local conditions and traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects  as an example of this.
Both projects are in emerging countries,  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
And also they have in common  that the different analyses from different perspectives  becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation  to design a multistory shopping mall  in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
And this is the type of building  we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,  of what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was,  I want to run away.
After seeing a few of these buildings --  there are many in the city --  we realized that they have three very big points.
First, these buildings, they are almost empty  because they have very large shops  where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, they need tons of energy to perform  because of the skin treatment with glass  that creates heat in the inside,  and then you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen  because they have really mild weather  that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
And third is that their image has nothing to do  with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,  I was really captivated by the old merkato  that is this open-air structure  where thousands of people, they go and buy things  every day from small vendors.
And also it has this idea of the public space  that uses the outdoors to create activity.
So I thought, this is what I really want to design,  not a shopping mall.
But the question was how we could do a multistory,  contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge was when we looked at the site,  that is, in a really growing area of the city,  where most of these buildings that you see in the image,  they were not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets  that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection  between these two streets,  putting all the entrances of the building.
And this extends with an inclined atrium  that creates an open-air space in the building  that self-protects itself with its own shape  from the sun and the rain.
And around this void  we placed this idea of the market with small shops,  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I really wanted to find a solution  that would respond to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about the textile  like a shell made of concrete  with perforations that would let the air in,  and also the light, but in a filtered way.
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
That they have fractal geometry properties  and this helped me to shape the whole facade.
And we are building that  with these small prefabricated pieces  that are the windows that let the air and the light  in a controlled way inside the building.
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses  that use the light from the inside of the building  to light up the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers  because they were like,  "This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."
But then we all realized that this idea of the market  happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall  because basically they had more shops to sell.
And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,  not only because of the material compared with the glass,  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
So we created some budget savings  that we used to implement the project.
And the first implementation was to think  about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy  in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
And then under those panels  we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars  that would create this urban oasis.
And these porches on the roof,  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan  of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina  that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,  opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did  was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks  similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona  and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
On top of that, we selected some strategic points  reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,  and this modified this initial pattern.
And the last operation was to think about the cell,  the small cell of the project, like the apartment,  as an essential part of the master plan.
And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation  in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house  and then a natural ventilation.
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments  are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result  that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with courtyards,  and then on the ground floor  you have all these connections for the pedestrians.
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish  a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project  is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,  and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,  jumping from one building to another.
These two examples,  they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see  the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow  changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more importance  to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions  that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment  and that aim to connect nature and people.
Thank you very much.
So when I was eight years old,  a new girl came to join the class,  and she was so impressive,  as the new girl always seems to be.
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair  and a cute little pencil case,  super strong on state capitals,  just a great speller.
And I just curdled with jealousy that year,  until I hatched my devious plan.
So one day I stayed a little late after school,  a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was clear, I emerged,  crept into the classroom,  and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.
And then I did it.
I fiddled with my rival's grades,  just a little, just demoted some of those A's.
All of those A's.   And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,  when hang on, some of my other classmates  had appallingly good grades too.
So, in a frenzy,  I corrected everybody's marks,  not imaginatively.
I gave everybody a row of D's  and I gave myself a row of A's,  just because I was there, you know, might as well.
And I am still baffled by my behavior.
I don't understand where the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
I felt great.
I don't understand why I was never caught.
I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.
I was never caught.
But most of all, I am baffled by,  why did it bother me so much  that this little girl, this tiny little girl,  was so good at spelling?
Jealousy baffles me.
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.
We know that jealousy is the number one cause  of spousal murder in the United States.
And yet, I have never read a study  that can parse to me its loneliness  or its longevity or its grim thrill.
For that, we have to go to fiction,  because the novel is the lab  that has studied jealousy  in every possible configuration.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say  that if we didn't have jealousy,  would we even have literature?
Well no faithless Helen, no "Odyssey."
No jealous king, no "Arabian Nights."
No Shakespeare.
There goes high school reading lists,  because we're losing "Sound and the Fury,"  we're losing "Gatsby," "Sun Also Rises,"  we're losing "Madame Bovary," "Anna K."
No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,  I know it's fashionable to say that Proust  has the answers to everything,  but in the case of jealousy,  he kind of does.
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time,"  and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy  and just regular competitiveness, my brand,  that we can hope to have.   And we think about Proust, we think  about the sentimental bits, right?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
We forget how harsh his vision was.
We forget how pitiless he is.
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said  were tough as cat gut.
I don't know what cat gut is,  but let's assume it's formidable.
Let's look at why they go so well together,  the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,  which boils down into person, desire, impediment,  is such a solid narrative foundation?
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,  because let's think about what happens  when we feel jealous.
When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,  and these stories make us feel terrible  because they're designed to make us feel terrible.
As the teller of the tale and the audience,  we know just what details to include,  to dig that knife in. Right?
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,  and this is something Proust understood.
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure  could be giving somebody else pleasure,  maybe right about now."
And this is the story he starts to tell himself,  and from then on, Proust writes that  every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,  he adds to his "collection of instruments  in his private torture chamber."
Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,  were notoriously jealous.
You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave  the country if they wanted to break up with him.
But you don't have to be that jealous  to concede that it's hard work. Right?
Jealousy is exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.
And what does jealousy like?
Jealousy likes information.
Jealousy likes details.
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,  the cute little pencil case.
Jealousy likes photos.
That's why Instagram is such a hit.   Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.
When Swann is in his jealous throes,  and suddenly he's listening at doorways  and bribing his mistress' servants,  he defends these behaviors.
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,  but it is no different  from interpreting an ancient text  or looking at a monument."
He says, "They are scientific investigations  with real intellectual value."
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy  feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,  but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,  a quest for truth, painful truth,  and actually, where Proust is concerned,  the more painful the truth, the better.
Grief, humiliation, loss:  These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.
He says, "A woman whom we need,  who makes us suffer, elicits from us  a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital  than a man of genius who interests us."
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?
No. I think he's trying to say  that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.
And does any other emotion crack us open  in this particular way?
Does any other emotion reveal to us  our aggression and our hideous ambition  and our entitlement?
Does any other emotion teach us to look  with such peculiar intensity?
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited  by this very anxious young man who was consumed  with the thought of his wife cheating on him.
And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,  because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.
The poor creature is just  under suspicion for no cause.
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing  without noticing, unintentional behaviors.
Is she smiling too brightly here,  or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?
[Freud] says that the man is becoming  the custodian of his wife's unconscious.
The novel is very good on this point.
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy  trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,  the more we become residents of fantasy.
And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't  just provoke us to do violent things  or illegal things.
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways  that are wildly inventive.
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,  but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught  creating a fake Facebook account  from which she sent vile, hideous messages  to herself for a year.
For a year. A year.
And she was trying to frame  her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,  and I have to confess when I heard this,  I just reacted with admiration.
Because, I mean, let's be real.
What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?
This is something from a novel.
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train"  and "The Talented Mr. Ripley,"  books that are all about how jealousy,  it muddles our minds,  and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,  the membrane between what is and what could be  can be pierced in an instant.
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you  or wanting what you have  to being you and having what you once had,  and you're under the floorboards,  he's answering to your name,  he's wearing your rings,  emptying your bank account.
That's one way to go.
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.
I can't give the world D's,  as much as I would really like to, some days.
And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.
We live in jealous times.
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,  aren't we, where the currency is envy?
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,  when they are in possession of a mystery.
Let's go to 221B Baker Street  and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
When people think of Holmes,  they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,  right, this criminal mastermind.
But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,  who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard  who needs Holmes desperately,  needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.
Oh, it's so familiar to me.
So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,  and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change,  and finally in "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"  once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,  Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,  "We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.
We're proud of you."
And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard  who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved  in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,  this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat jealousy  as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself  admire this mind that he's resented.
Could it be so simple though?
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,  just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand  in relation to another?
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent  somebody's excellence.
We could align ourselves with it.
But I like contingency plans.
So while we wait for that to happen,  let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.
Fiction alone domesticates it,  invites it to the table.
And look who it gathers:  sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,  crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
So, we used to solve big problems.
On July 21st, 1969,  Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module  and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,  but their presence on the moon's gray surface  was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
The Apollo program was the greatest  peacetime mobilization  in the history of the United States.
To get to the moon, NASA spent  around 180 billion dollars in today's money,  or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo employed around 400,000 people  and demanded the collaboration of 20,000  companies, universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program ended,  24 men flew to the moon.
Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,  following the death of Armstrong last year,  is now the most senior.
So why did they go?
They didn't bring much back:  841 pounds of old rocks,  and something all 24 later emphasized --  a new sense of the smallness  and the fragility of our common home.
Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went  because President Kennedy wanted to show  the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962  provide a better clue.
John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?
Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask,  why climb the highest mountain?
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
Why does Rice play Texas?
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade,  and do the other things,  not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,  Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East  in the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion  was of wonder  at the transcendent powers of technology.
They went because it was a big thing to do.
Landing on the moon occurred in the context  of a long series of technological triumphs.
The first half of the 20th century produced  the assembly line and the airplane,  penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle years of the century,  polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
Technology itself seemed to possess  what Alvin Toffler in 1970  called "accelerative thrust."
For most of human history,  we could go no faster than a horse  or a boat with a sail,  but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10  flew at 25,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human beings  have been back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew  of Apollo 10,  and blithe optimism about technology's powers  has evaporated  as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,  such as going to Mars,  creating clean energy, curing cancer,  or feeding the world have come to seem  intractably hard.
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
I was five years old,  and my mother told me not to stare  at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
I vaguely knew this was to be the last  of the moon missions,  but I was absolutely certain there would be  Mars colonies in my lifetime.
So "Something happened  to our capacity to solve big problems with technology"  has become a commonplace.
You hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It feels as if technologists have diverted us  and enriched themselves with trivial toys,  with things like iPhones and apps and social media,  or algorithms that speed automated trading.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve humanity's big problems.
What happened?
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,  which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies  than it did in the years when it financed  Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,  in particular the incentives that venture capitalists  offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that venture investing  shifted away from funding transformational ideas  and towards funding incremental problems  or even fake problems.
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their most  risk-happy, they preferred small investments,  tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
V.C.s have always struggled  to invest profitably in technologies such as energy  whose capital requirements are huge  and whose development is long and lengthy,  and V.C.s have never, never funded the development  of technologies meant to solve big problems  that possess no immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems  are more complicated and more profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA even has the outline of a plan.
But going to Mars would follow a political decision  with popular appeal, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks  there are more important things  to do here on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems  because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent  of the world's energy consumption  derives from advanced, renewable sources  such as solar, wind and biofuels,  less than two percent,  and the reason is purely economic.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper  than solar and wind,  and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
We want alternative energy sources  that can compete on price. None exist.
Now, technologists, business leaders  and economists all basically agree  on what national policies and international treaties  would spur the development of alternative energy:  mostly, a significant increase in energy  research and development,  and some kind of price on carbon.
But there's no hope in the present political climate  that we will see U.S. energy policy  or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological  turn out not to be so.
Famines were long understood to be caused  by failures in food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us  that famines are political crises  that catastrophically affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like crop yields  or systems for storing and transporting food,  but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution  because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,  but we soon discovered  there are many kinds of cancer,  most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,  and it is only in the last 10 years  that effective, viable therapies  have come to seem real.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
We can, we must, but these four elements  must all be present:  Political leaders and the public  must care to solve a problem;  institutions must support its solution;  It must really be a technological problem;  and we must understand it.
The Apollo mission,  which has become a kind of metaphor  for technology's capacity to solve big problems,  met these criteria.
But it is an irreproducible model for the future.
It is not 1961.
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,  no politician like John Kennedy  who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,  and no popular science fictional mythology  such as exploring the solar system.
Most of all, going to the moon  turned out to be easy.
It was just three days away.
And arguably it wasn't even solving  much of a problem.
We are left alone with our day,  and the solutions of the future will be harder won.
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
Thank you very much.
So I'm going to talk about trust,  and I'm going to start by reminding you  of the standard views that people have about trust.
I think these are so commonplace,  they've become clichs of our society.
And I think there are three.
One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,  very widely believed.
The second is an aim: we should have more trust.
And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
I think that the claim, the aim and the task  are all misconceived.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today  is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task  which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,  I don't know the answer.
I'm inclined to think it may have declined  in some activities or some institutions  and it might have grown in others.
I don't have an overview.
But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,  and the opinion polls are supposedly  the source of a belief that trust has declined.
When you actually look at opinion polls across time,  there's not much evidence for that.
That's to say, the people who were mistrusted  20 years ago,  principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago  are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in between,  and by the way, the average person in the street  is almost exactly midway.
But is that good evidence?
What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
What else can they record?
So they're looking at the generic attitudes  that people report when you ask them certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
Do you trust fishmongers?
Do you trust elementary school teachers?"
you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,  "Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
That's a perfectly rational thing.
In short, in our real lives,  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust  that we will have in every instance of a certain type  of official or office-holder or type of person  is going to be uniform.
I might, for example, say that I certainly trust  a certain elementary school teacher I know  to teach the reception class to read,  but in no way to drive the school minibus.
I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
I might trust my most loquacious friend  to keep a conversation going  but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.
Simple.
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives  of the way that trust is differentiated,  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence  when we think about trust more abstractly?
I think the polls are very bad guides  to the level of trust that actually exists,  because they try to obliterate the good judgment  that goes into placing trust.
Secondly, what about the aim?
The aim is to have more trust.
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
It's not what I would aim at.
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy  but not in the untrustworthy.
In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
And I think, of those people who, for example,  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,  who then made off with them,  and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,  too much trust.
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust  is the proper aim.
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,  that means that what matters in the first place  is not trust but trustworthiness.
It's judging how trustworthy people are  in particular respects.
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
And if we find that a person is competent  in the relevant matters,  and reliable and honest,  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,  because they'll be trustworthy.
But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
I have friends who are competent and honest,  but I would not trust them to post a letter,  because they're forgetful.
I have friends who are very confident  they can do certain things,  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends  who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
If so, I haven't yet spotted it.
But that's what we're looking for:  trustworthiness before trust.
Trust is the response.
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
And, of course, it's difficult.
Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct  systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions  and professionals and officials and so on  that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.
They don't work as they're supposed to.
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,  "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer  to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
And all over our public life, our institutional life,  we find that problem,  that the system of accountability  that is meant to secure trustworthiness  and evidence of trustworthiness  is actually doing the opposite.
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,  like midwives, from doing them  by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
You can all give your own examples there.
So so much for the aim.
The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,  and that is going to be different  if we are trying to be trustworthy  and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,  and if we are trying to judge whether other people  or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,  attitudes, don't do adequately here.
Now thirdly, the task.
Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,  also gets things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do that for ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
But trust, in the end, is distinctive  because it's given by other people.
You can't rebuild what other people give you.
You have to give them the basis  for giving you their trust.
So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
And that, of course, is because you can't fool  all of the people all of the time, usually.
But you also have to provide usable evidence  that you are trustworthy.
How to do it?
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done  by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,  quite effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,  and they don't ask any questions.
They take them back and give me the money  or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
That's super. I trust them  because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy  and you have confidence in what you are saying.
So in the end, I think what we are aiming for  is not very difficult to discern.
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy  and can judge when and how the other person  is trustworthy.
Thanks.
Throughout the history of computers  we've been striving to shorten the gap between us  and digital information,  the gap between our physical world  and the world in the screen  where our imagination can go wild.
And this gap has become shorter,  shorter, and even shorter,  and now this gap is shortened down  to less than a millimeter,  the thickness of a touch-screen glass,  and the power of computing  has become accessible to everyone.
But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
I started to imagine what this would look like.
First, I created this tool  which penetrates into the digital space,  so when you press it hard on the screen,  it transfers its physical body into pixels.
Designers can materialize their ideas  directly in 3D,  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs  underneath the screen.
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.
How can you reach inside and interact  with the digital information  using the full dexterity of our hands?
At Microsoft Applied Sciences,  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,  I redesigned the computer  and turned a little space above the keyboard  into a digital workspace.
By combining a transparent display and depth cameras  for sensing your fingers and face,  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard  and reach inside this 3D space  and grab pixels with your bare hands.
Because windows and files have a position in the real space,  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
Then you can flip through this book  while highlighting the lines, words  on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
Architects can stretch or rotate the models  with their two hands directly.
So in these examples,  we are reaching into the digital world.
But how about reversing its role  and having the digital information reach us instead?
I'm sure many of us have had the experience  of buying and returning items online.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
This is a view that you get from  head-mounted or see-through display  when the system understands the geometry of your body.
Taking this idea further, I started to think,  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space,  how can we make it physical  so that we can touch and feel it?
What would such a future look like?
At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii  and my collaborator Rehmi Post,  we created this one physical pixel.
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet  acts like a 3D pixel in our space,  which means that both computers and people  can move this object to anywhere  within this little 3D space.
What we did was essentially canceling gravity  and controlling the movement by combining  magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation  and sensing technologies.
And by digitally programming the object,  we are liberating the object from constraints  of time and space, which means that now,  human motions can be recorded and played back  and left permanently in the physical world.
So choreography can be taught physically over distance  and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated  over and over as a physical reality.
Students can use this as a tool  to learn about the complex concepts  such as planetary motion, physics,  and unlike computer screens or textbooks,  this is a real, tangible experience  that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
And what's more exciting  than just turning what's currently in the computer physical  is to start imagining how programming the world  will alter even our daily physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information  will not just show us something  but it will start directly acting upon us  as a part of our physical surroundings  without disconnecting ourselves from our world.
Today, we started by talking about the boundary,  but if we remove this boundary,  the only boundary left is our imagination.
Thank you.
So I was trained to become a gymnast  for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government  wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,  all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become  an engineer like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,  they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:  a safe and well-paid job.
It is not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
That is me playing my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start training young  to learn acrobatics,  so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I even wrote to the school principal  and the host of a radio show.
But no adults liked the idea.
No adults believed I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,  just as powerless as I was.
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
My dream would never come true.
I was afraid that for the rest of my life  some second-class happiness  would be the best I could hope for.
But that's so unfair.
So I was determined to find another calling.
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.
I turned to books.
["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]  I came to the U.S. in 1995,  so which books did I read here first?
Books banned in China, of course.
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for a different day.
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:  "You shall honor your father and mother."
"Honor," I said. "That's so different,  and better, than obey."
So it becomes my tool to climb out  of this Confucian guilt trap  and to restart my relationship with my parents.
Encountering a new culture also started my habit  of comparative reading.
It offers many insights.
For example, I found this map out of place at first  because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
It had never occurred to me,  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map actually carries somebody's view.
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.
It's a standard practice in the academic world.
There are even research fields  such as comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast gives scholars  a more complete understanding of a topic.
So I thought, well, if comparative reading  works for research, why not do it in daily life too?
So I started reading books in pairs.
So they can be about people --  ["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --  who are involved in the same event,  or friends with shared experiences.
For the Christ, the temptations  are economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they are all psychological:  lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun  to read your favorite books in two languages.
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]  Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
For example, it's through translation that I realized  "happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people  of the past and the present.
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
Having a dream shattered really is nothing  compared to what many others have suffered.
I have come to believe that coming true  is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch  with where dreams come from,  where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.
So because of books, I'm here today,  happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,  most of the time.
So may books be always with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.   Thank you.
When I was in my 20s,  I saw my very first psychotherapy client.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,  and she dropped onto the couch in my office  and kicked off her flats  and told me she was there to talk about guy problems.
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client.
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys.
This I thought I could handle.
But I didn't handle it.
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session,  it was easy for me just to nod my head  while we kicked the can down the road.
"Thirty's the new 20," Alex would say,  and as far as I could tell, she was right.
Work happened later, marriage happened later,  kids happened later, even death happened later.
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time.
But before long, my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
I pushed back.
I said, "Sure, she's dating down,  she's sleeping with a knucklehead,  but it's not like she's going to marry the guy."
And then my supervisor said,  "Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
Besides, the best time to work on Alex's marriage  is before she has one."
That's what psychologists call an "Aha!" moment.
That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people settle down later than they used to,  but that didn't make Alex's 20s a developmental downtime.
That made Alex's 20s a developmental sweet spot,  and we were sitting there, blowing it.
That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect  was a real problem, and it had real consequences,  not just for Alex and her love life  but for the careers and the families and the futures  of twentysomethings everywhere.
There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population,  or 100 percent if you consider  that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I really want to see some twentysomethings here.
Oh, yay! You are all awesome.
If you work with twentysomethings, you love a twentysomething,  you're losing sleep over twentysomethings, I want to see   Okay. Awesome, twentysomethings really matter.
This is not my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments  take place by age 35.
That means that eight out of 10  of the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments  that make your life what it is  will have happened by your mid-30s.
People who are over 40, don't panic.
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career  has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
We know that more than half of Americans  are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.
We know that the brain caps off  its second and last growth spurt in your 20s  as it rewires itself for adulthood,  which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself,  now is the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more during your 20s  than at any other time in life,  and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28,  and things get tricky after age 35.
So your 20s are the time to educate yourself  about your body and your options.
So when we think about child development,  we all know that the first five years are a critical period  for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a time when your ordinary, day-to-day life  has an inordinate impact on who you will become.
But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing  as adult development,  and our 20s are that critical period of adult development.
But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing.
Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood.
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence.
Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings  like "twixters" and "kidults."
It's true!
As a culture, we have trivialized  what is actually the defining decade of adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things,  you need a plan and not quite enough time.
Isn't that true?
So what do you think happens  when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say,  "You have 10 extra years to start your life"?
Nothing happens.
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition,  and absolutely nothing happens.
And then every day, smart, interesting twentysomethings  like you or like your sons and daughters  come into my office and say things like this:  "I know my boyfriend's no good for me,  but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says as long as I get started  on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this:  "My 20s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.
I had a better rsum the day after I graduated from college."
And then it starts to sound like this:  "Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs.
Everybody was running around and having fun,  but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off  and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one left standing up,  so sometimes I think I married my husband  because he was the closest chair to me at 30."
Where are the twentysomethings here?
Do not do that.
Okay, now that sounds a little flip, but make no mistake,  the stakes are very high.
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,  there is enormous thirtysomething pressure  to jump-start a career, pick a city, partner up,  and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are incompatible,  and as research is just starting to show,  simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s.
The post-millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car.
It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.
It's realizing you can't have that child you now want,  or you can't give your child a sibling.
Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings  look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room,  and say about their 20s,  "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how that can go.
It's a story about a woman named Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office  because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,  but she hadn't decided yet,  so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
Because it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend  who displayed his temper more than his ambition.
And as hard as her 20s were,  her early life had been even harder.
She often cried in our sessions,  but then would collect herself by saying,  "You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,  and she sobbed for most of the hour.
She'd just bought a new address book,  and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts,  but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank  that comes after the words  "In case of emergency, please call ..."
She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said,  "Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck?
Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer?"
Now in that moment, it took everything I had  not to say, "I will."
But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex  to just sit there while Emma's defining decade  went parading by.
So over the next weeks and months,  I told Emma three things  that every twentysomething, male or female,  deserves to hear.
First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis  and get some identity capital.
By "get identity capital,"  I mean do something that adds value to who you are.
Do something that's an investment  in who you might want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career,  and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this:  Identity capital begets identity capital.
So now is the time for that cross-country job,  that internship, that startup you want to try.
I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,  but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,  which, by the way, is not exploration.
That's procrastination.
I told Emma to explore work and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport,  but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers  limit who they know,  what they know, how they think,  how they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person to date  almost always comes from outside the inner circle.
New things come from what are called our weak ties,  our friends of friends of friends.
So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.
But half aren't,  and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
Half of new jobs are never posted,  so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads.
Last but not least, Emma believed  that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
Now this was true for her growing up,  but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family  when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down  than 20, or even 25,  and I agree with you.
But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with  when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle  is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,  and that means being as intentional with love  as you are with work.
Picking your family is about consciously choosing  who and what you want  rather than just making it work or killing time  with whoever happens to be choosing you.
So what happened to Emma?
Well, we went through that address book,  and she found an old roommate's cousin  who worked at an art museum in another state.
That weak tie helped her get a job there.
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend.
Now, five years later, she's a special events planner for museums.
She's married to a man she mindfully chose.
She loves her new career, she loves her new family,  and she sent me a card that said,  "Now the emergency contact blanks  don't seem big enough."
Now Emma's story made that sound easy,  but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings.
They are so easy to help.
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX,  bound for somewhere west.
Right after takeoff, a slight change in course  is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji.
Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,  one good conversation, one good break,  one good TED Talk, can have an enormous effect  across years and even generations to come.
So here's an idea worth spreading  to every twentysomething you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege  of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day:  Thirty is not the new 20, so claim your adulthood,  get some identity capital, use your weak ties,  pick your family.
Don't be defined by what you didn't know  or didn't do.
You're deciding your life right now.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old,  I left a very demanding job in management consulting  for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.
I went to teach seventh graders math  in the New York City public schools.
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.
I gave out homework assignments.
When the work came back, I calculated grades.
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference  between my best and my worst students.
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,  sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.
But these concepts are not impossible,  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students  could learn the material  if they worked hard and long enough.
After several more years of teaching,  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education  is a much better understanding of students and learning  from a motivational perspective,  from a psychological perspective.
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.
But what if doing well in school and in life  depends on much more  than your ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left the classroom,  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults  in all kinds of super challenging settings,  and in every study my question was,  who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.
We tried to predict which cadets  would stay in military training and which would drop out.
We went to the National Spelling Bee  and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods,  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching  by the end of the school year,  and of those, who will be the most effective  at improving learning outcomes for their students?
We partnered with private companies, asking,  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?
And who's going to earn the most money?
In all those very different contexts,  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ.
It was grit.
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
Grit is having stamina.
Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,  not just for the week, not just for the month,  but for years,  and working really hard to make that future a reality.
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.
A few years ago,  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school juniors  to take grit questionnaires,  and then waited around more than a year  to see who would graduate.
Turns out that grittier kids  were significantly more likely to graduate,  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,  things like family income,  standardized achievement test scores,  even how safe kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee  that grit matters. It's also in school,  especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
To me, the most shocking thing about grit  is how little we know,  how little science knows, about building it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,  "How do I build grit in kids?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"
The honest answer is, I don't know.   What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.
Our data show very clearly  that there are many talented individuals  who simply do not follow through on their commitments.
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated  or even inversely related to measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids  is something called "growth mindset."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,  that it can change with your effort.
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain  and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks,  because that's where we are.
That's the work that stands before us.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,  and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether we've been successful,  and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,  to start over again with lessons learned.
In other words, we need to be gritty  about getting our kids grittier.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan  as the daughter of a calligrapher,  one of my most treasured memories  was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape  and the form of Chinese characters.
Ever since then, I was fascinated  by this incredible language.
But to an outsider, it seems to be  as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
Over the past few years, I've been wondering  if I can break down this wall,  so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate  the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
I started thinking about how a new, fast method  of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw  every single stroke for each character  in the correct sequence.
I learned new characters every day  during the course of the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes,  it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend  40 percent of basic literature --  enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,  to understand the basic idea of the web pages  or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight  to show you how the method works.
You are ready?
Open your mouth as wide as possible  until it's square.
You get a mouth.
This is a person going for a walk.
Person.
If the shape of the fire is a person  with two arms on both sides,  as if she was yelling frantically,  "Help! I'm on fire!" --  This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,  but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.
This is a tree.
Tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door  looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.
I call these eight characters radicals.
They are the building blocks  for you to create lots more characters.
A person.
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow."
As the old saying goes,  two is company, three is a crowd.
If a person stretched their arms wide,  this person is saying, "It was this big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.
Three trees together, we create the forest.
Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot."   Easy to remember,  since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.
Remember fire?
Two fires together, I get really hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperous.
Three together, that's sparkles.
Put the sun and the moon shining together,  it's brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.
A door. Put a plank inside the door,  it's a door bolt.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
Knock knock. Is anyone home?
This person is sneaking out of a door,  escaping, evading.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they have an argument.
Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.
So we have gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radicals  will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters  will build an extra 32.
So with very little effort,  you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,  which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.
So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.
For example, the mountain and the fire together,  we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin,  because Japan lies to the east of China.
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we get?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains  stacked on top of each other.
In ancient China, that means in exile,  because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies  in exile beyond mountains.
Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.
A mouth which tells you where to get out  is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking  and get off of the stage. Thank you.
You know, my favorite part of being a dad  is the movies I get to watch.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,  and when my daughter was four,  we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.
It totally dominated her imagination for months.
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress  and carry a wand.
But you watch that movie enough times,  and you start to realize how unusual it is.
Now we live today, and are raising our children,  in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
It did not start that trend.
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,  with, interestingly, another movie  that featured a metal guy  and a furry guy  rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.
Do you know what I'm talking about?   Yeah.
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,  a couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"  and all the movies we watch today.
One is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."
The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
But I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,  the wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz  that the prophecy foretold.
Use your magic slippers to defeat  the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."
But that's not how it happens.
Another thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"  to me is that all of the most heroic  and wise and even villainous characters  are female.
Now I started to notice this  when I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,  which was years later, and the situation was different.
At that point I also had a son.
He was only three at the time.
He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
But he was the second child,  and the level of supervision had plummeted.   So he wandered in,  and it imprinted on him  like a mommy duck does to its duckling,  and I don't think he understands what's going on,  but he is sure soaking in it.
And I wonder what he's soaking in.
Is he picking up on the themes of courage  and perseverance and loyalty?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke  joins an army to overthrow the government?
Compare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."
How does Dorothy win her movie?
By making friends with everybody  and being a leader.
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --  Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,  which is where we kind of have to be.
Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --  in the movies we have for our kids,  and so little yellow brick road?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact  that the boy-violent movie has on girls,  and you should do that reading. It's very good.
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.
I know from my own experience that  Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context  that I could have used in navigating the adult world  that is co-ed.   I think there was a first-kiss moment  when I really expected the credits to start rolling  because that's the end of the movie, right?
I finished my quest, I got the girl.
Why are you still standing there?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain  and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room  for other relationships and other journeys.
It's almost as though if you're a boy,  you are a dopey animal,  and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.
There are plenty of exceptions,  and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
But they do send a message to boys,  that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls  how to defend against the patriarchy,  but they are not necessarily showing boys  how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.
There's no models for them.
And we also have some terrific women  who are writing new stories for our kids,  and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,  these are still war movies.
And, of course, the most successful studio of all time  continues to crank out classic after classic,  every single one of them about  the journey of a boy, or a man,  or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,  or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,  when they finally came out with "Brave."
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
Do you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?
"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.
I don't know if you've heard of this.
It has not yet caught on and caught fire,  but maybe today we will start a movement.
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,  and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation  she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:  Is there more than one character in the movie  that is female who has lines?
So try to meet that bar.
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
And is their conversation about something other than  the guy that they both like?   Right? Thank you.   Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
It does happen. I've seen it,  and yet I very rarely see it in the movies  that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see  a very high-quality movie, "Argo."
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,  a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,  I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie  takes place in this embassy where men and women  are hiding out during the hostage crisis.
We've got quite a few scenes of the men  having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,  and the great moment for one of the actresses is  to peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"
That's Hollywood for you.
So let's look at the numbers.
2011, of the 100 most popular movies,  how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
Eleven. It's not bad.
It's not as many percent as the number of women  we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.
But there is a number that is greater than this  that's going to bring this room down.
Last year, The New York Times published a study  that the government had done.
Here's what it said.
One out of five women in America  say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.
I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.
I don't even think that  music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,  but something is going wrong,  and when I hear that statistic,  one of the things I think of is  that's a lot of sexual assailants.
Who are these guys? What are they learning?
What are they failing to learn?
Are they absorbing the story that  a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence  and then collect the reward, which is a woman  who has no friends and doesn't speak?
Are we soaking up that story?
You know,  as a parent with the privilege  of raising a daughter  like all of you who are doing the same thing,  we find this world and this statistic very alarming  and we want to prepare them.
We have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"  and we hope that that will help,  but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them  if, at the same time, actively or passively,  we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?
I mean, I think the Netflix queue  is one way that we can do something very important,  and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.
I think we have got to show our sons  a new definition of manhood.
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.
You've read about how the new economy  is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.
They're throwing it up in the air.
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"  do you know what she said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do these two have in common?
Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.
I think these people are experts.
I think these are the two people in the movie  who know more than anybody else,  and they love sharing their knowledge with other people  to help them reach their potential.
Now, they are leaders.
I like that kind of quest for my daughter,  and I like that kind of quest for my son.
I want more quests like that.
I want fewer quests where my son is told,  "Go out and fight it alone,"  and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,  maybe a team led by women,  to help other people become better  and be better people,  like the Wizard of Oz.
Thank you.
When I was a child growing up in Maine,  one of my favorite things to do  was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine,  because my parents told me it would bring me luck.
But you know, these shells, they're hard to find.
They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.
However, over time, I got used to looking for them.
I started seeing shapes  and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This grew into a passion for finding things,  a love for the past and archaeology.
And eventually, when I started studying Egyptology,  I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,  my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine  to one eight hundred miles long,  next to the Nile.
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery.
For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently  using the infrared.
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta  called Mendes.
And the site visibly appears brown,  but when we use the infrared  and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color,  the site appears as bright pink.
What you are seeing  are the actual chemical changes to the landscape  caused by the building materials and activities  of the ancient Egyptians.
What I want to share with you today  is how we've used satellite data  to find an ancient Egyptian city,  called Itjtawy,  missing for thousands of years.
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital  for over four hundred years,  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,  about four thousand years ago.
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,  and the site is really important,  because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance  for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy  was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,  indicated within the red circles here,  but somewhere within this massive flood plain.
This area is huge --  it's four miles by three miles in size.
The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,  it covered over the city.
So, how do you find a buried city  in a vast landscape?
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent  of locating a needle in a haystack,  blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.
So what we did is we used NASA topography data  to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.
But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,  this very slight raised area  seen within the circle up here  which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists  to do coring work, which you see here.
When I say coring, it's like ice coring,  but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layers of human occupation.
And, five meters down,  underneath a thick layer of mud,  we found a dense layer of pottery.
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,  five meters down,  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,  dating to the Middle Kingdom,  dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.
We also found work stone --  carnelian, quartz and agate  that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.
These might not look like much,  but when you think about the most common stones  used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,  these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation  dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.
We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,  showing that whatever was there was a very important city.
No Itjtawy was here yet,  but we're going to be returning to the site  in the near future to map it out.
And even more importantly,  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology  so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom --  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.
"Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.
There's nothing like it in the land."
So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC  at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
I'd like you to notice the color of the door,  the material that it's made out of.
Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.
They are competing in a naked bicycle race,  and they are headed straight for your front door.
I need you to actually see this.
They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty,  they're bouncing around a lot.
And they crash straight into the front door of your home.
Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,  spokes end up in awkward places.
Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway,  whatever's on the other side,  and appreciate the quality of the light.
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster.
Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.
It's a talking horse.
You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.
Walk past him into your living room.
In your living room, in full imaginative broadband,  picture Britney Spears.
She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table,  and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."
And then, follow me into your kitchen.
In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road,  and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,  the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz,"  hand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest  that is held every spring in New York City.
It's called the United States Memory Championship.
And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back  as a science journalist,  expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,  looking at them just once.
They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.
They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.
They were competing to see who could memorize  the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.
I was like, this is unbelievable.
These people must be freaks of nature.
And I started talking to a few of the competitors.
This is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,  where he had one of the best-trained memories.
And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize  that you were a savant?"
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.
In fact, I have just an average memory.
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you  that they have just an average memory.
We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory  using a set of ancient techniques,  techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."
And I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"
And we were standing outside the competition hall,  and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,  says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
Do you know Britney Spears?"
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"
"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears  how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards  on U.S. national television.
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this."
I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,  but maybe you could teach me.
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending the better part of the next year  not only training my memory,  but also investigating it,  trying to understand how it works,  why it sometimes doesn't work,  and what its potential might be.
And I met a host of really interesting people.
This is a guy called E.P.
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,  the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad,  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,  which is amazing.
And he was this incredibly tragic figure,  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character  in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library  memorizing phone books,  which was scintillating.
And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,  treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,  in antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.
One of the really interesting things that I learned  is that once upon a time,  this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory  was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.
Once upon a time, people invested in their memories,  in laboriously furnishing their minds.
These technologies have made our modern world possible,  but they've also changed us.
They've changed us culturally,  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.
Having little need to remember anymore,  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.
One of the last places on Earth where you still find  people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,  is at this totally singular memory contest.
It's actually not that singular,  there are contests held all over the world.
And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London  brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.
They wanted to know:  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,  anatomically different from the rest of ours?
The answer was no.
Are they smarter than the rest of us?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.
There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference  between the brains of the memory champions  and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.
When they put these guys in an fMRI machine,  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers  and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain  than everyone else.
Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.
Why? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?
The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,  every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,  and then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore,  three-time world memory champion.
On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards  that he is about to try to memorize in one hour,  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.
He used a similar technique  to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits  in half an hour.
Yeah.
And while there are a whole host of ways  of remembering stuff in these competitions,  everything, all of the techniques that are being used,  ultimately come down to a concept  that psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding."
And it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox  known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:  If I tell two people to remember the same word,  if I say to you,  "Remember that there is a guy named Baker."
That's his name.
And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."
And I come back to you at some point later on,  and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?
Do you remember what it was?"
The person who was told his name is Baker  is less likely to remember the same word  than the person was told his job is a baker.
Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.
What's going on here?
Well, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull.
But the common noun "baker" -- we know bakers.
Bakers wear funny white hats.
Bakers have flour on their hands.
Bakers smell good when they come home from work.
Maybe we even know a baker.
And when we first hear that word,  we start putting these associational hooks into it,  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this  dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.
It came to be known as the memory palace.
The story behind its creation goes like this:  There was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.
He was actually the hired entertainment,  because back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,  you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.
And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,  and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses.
Kills everybody inside.
It doesn't just kill everybody,  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.
Nobody can say who was inside,  nobody can say where they were sitting.
The bodies can't be properly buried.
It's one tragedy compounding another.
Simonides, standing outside,  the sole survivor amid the wreckage,  closes his eyes and has this realization,  which is that in his mind's eye,  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.
And he takes the relatives by the hand,  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.
What Simonides figured out at that moment,  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,  which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,  and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.
If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story  that I just told you about Simonides,  chances are you would have a tough time with it.
But, I would wager that if I asked you to recall  who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse  in your foyer right now,  you would be able to see that.
The idea behind the memory palace  is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember --  the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,  funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,  the more unforgettable it's likely to be.
This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years  to the earliest Latin memory treatises.
So how does this work?
Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,  and you want to do it from memory,  and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it,  if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
What you might do  is picture yourself at the front door of your house.
And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about  is this totally bizarre contest.
And then you'd go inside your house,  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.
And that would remind you  that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears  to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.
And you'd go into your kitchen,  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about  was this strange journey that you went on for a year,  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.
This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches --  not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,  but topic-for-topic.
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --  that comes from the Greek word "topos,"  which means "place."
That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric  in these sorts of spatial terms.
The phrase "in the first place,"  that's like "in the first place of your memory palace."
I thought this was just fascinating,  and I got really into it.
And I went to a few more of these memory contests,  and I had this notion that I might write something longer  about this subculture of competitive memorizers.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory contest  is a pathologically boring event.
Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs --  I mean, the most dramatic it gets  is when somebody starts massaging their temples.
And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.
I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,  but I don't have access to it.
And I realized, if I was going to tell this story,  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes  every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,  just trying to remember something.
Maybe it was a poem,  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.
And I found that this was shockingly fun.
I never would have expected that.
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.
What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better  at creating, at dreaming up,  these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.
And I got pretty into it.
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.
It's a pair of earmuffs  and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over  except for two small pinholes,  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.
I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier,  and I had this notion that I might enter it,  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.
It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.
Problem was, the experiment went haywire.
I won the contest --  which really wasn't supposed to happen.
Now, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches  and phone numbers and shopping lists,  but it's actually kind of beside the point.
These are just tricks.
They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles  about how our brains work.
And you don't have to be building memory palaces  or memorizing packs of playing cards  to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with great memories  as though it were some sort of an innate gift,  but that is not the case.
Great memories are learned.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we are deeply engaged.
The memory palace, these memory techniques --  they're just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even really shortcuts.
They work because they make you work.
They force a kind of depth of processing,  a kind of mindfulness,  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising.
But there actually are no shortcuts.
This is how stuff is made memorable.
And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,  it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,  left me with,  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose  from our already short lives,  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,  by not paying attention to the human being across from us  who is talking with us,  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?
I learned firsthand  that there are incredible memory capacities  latent in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life,  you have to be the kind of person  who remembers to remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to speak to you  about the last 30 years of architectural history.
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic,  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place:  New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,  and I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house  in a town called Livingston,  and this was my childhood bedroom.
Around the corner from my bedroom  was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.
And in between my bedroom and the bathroom  was a balcony that overlooked the family room.
And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV,  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom,  everyone would see me,  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel,  everyone would see me.
And I looked like this.
I was awkward,  insecure, and I hated it.
I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,  I hated that room, and I hated that house.
And that's architecture.
Done.
That feeling, those emotions that I felt,  that's the power of architecture,  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning,  it's about those visceral, emotional connections  that we feel to the places that we occupy.
And it's no surprise that we feel that way,  because according to the EPA,  Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.
That's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.
That's huge.
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.
That makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.
It means that when I show you a building like this,  I know what you think:  You think "power" and "stability" and "democracy."
And I know you think that because it's based on a building  that was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
This is a trigger that architects use  to get you to create an emotional connection  to the forms that we build our buildings out of.
It's a predictable emotional connection,  and we've been using this trick for a long, long time.
We used it [200] years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America,  we used it to build houses.
And look at these solid, stable little soldiers  facing the ocean and keeping away the elements.
This is really, really useful,  because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
And the people that build things --  developers and governments --  they're naturally afraid of innovation,  and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
This is a nice building.
This is the Livingston Public Library  that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,  and, you know, it's got a dome  and it's got this round thing and columns, red brick,  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building:  children, property values and history.
But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country,  another library was completed,  and it looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library is about how we consume media in a digital age.
It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city,  a place to gather and read and share.
So how is it possible  that in the same year, in the same country,  two buildings, both called libraries,  look so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum.
On the one side is innovation,  and architects are constantly pushing, pushing for new technologies,  new typologies, new solutions for the way that we live today.
And we push and we push and we push  until we completely alienate all of you.
We wear all black, we get very depressed,  you think we're adorable,  we're dead inside because we've got no choice.
We have to go to the other side  and reengage those symbols that we know you love.
So we do that, and you're happy,  we feel like sellouts,  so we start experimenting again  and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth  we've gone for the last 300 years,  and certainly for the last 30 years.
Okay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s.
Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism.
It's about concrete.
You can guess this.
Small windows, dehumanizing scale.
This is really tough stuff.
So as we get closer to the '80s,  we start to reengage those symbols.
We push the pendulum back into the other direction.
We take these forms that we know you love  and we update them.
We add neon  and we add pastels  and we use new materials.
And you love it.
And we can't give you enough of it.
We take Chippendale armoires  and we turned those into skyscrapers,  and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass.
Forms got big,  forms got bold and colorful.
Dwarves became columns.
Swans grew to the size of buildings.
It was crazy.
But it's the '80s, it's cool.
We're all hanging out in malls  and we're all moving to the suburbs,  and out there, out in the suburbs,  we can create our own architectural fantasies.
And those fantasies,  they can be Mediterranean  or French  or Italian.
Possibly with endless breadsticks.
This is the thing about postmodernism.
This is the thing about symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap,  because instead of making places,  we're making memories of places.
Because I know, and I know all of you know,  this isn't Tuscany.
This is Ohio.
So architects get frustrated,  and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction.
In the late '80s and early '90s,  we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism.
We throw out historical symbols,  we rely on new, computer-aided design techniques,  and we come up with new compositions,  forms crashing into forms.
This is academic and heady stuff,  it's super unpopular,  we totally alienate you.
Ordinarily, the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction.
And then, something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building opened.
This is the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry.
And this building  fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.
Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments  when critics, academics, and the general public  were completely united around a building.
The New York Times called this building a miracle.
Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent  after this building was completed.
So all of a sudden, everybody wants one of these buildings:  L.A.,  Seattle,  Chicago,  New York,  Cleveland,  Springfield.
Everybody wants one, and Gehry is everywhere.
He is our very first starchitect.
Now, how is it possible that these forms --  they're wild and radical --  how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them  that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction to these forms.
So did every mayor in the world.
So every mayor knew that if they had these forms,  they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium  happened to a few other starchitects.
It happened to Zaha  and it happened to Libeskind,  and what happened to these elite few architects  at the turn of the new millennium  could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture,  as digital media starts to increase the speed  with which we consume information.
Because think about how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago,  you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.
Transportation speeds up:  You can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tourist.
Technology speeds up: You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,  until finally, we are all architectural photographers,  and the building has become disembodied from the site.
Architecture is everywhere now,  and that means that the speed of communication  has finally caught up to the speed of architecture.
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly.
It doesn't take long to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building,  three or four years,  and in the interim, an architect will design two or eight  or a hundred other buildings  before they know if that building that they designed four years ago  was a success or not.
That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
Brutalism wasn't a two-year movement,  it was a 20-year movement.
For 20 years, we were producing buildings like this  because we had no idea how much you hated it.
It's never going to happen again,  I think,  because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture  since the invention of concrete,  of steel, or of the elevator,  and it's a media revolution.
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum,  it starts swinging faster and faster,  until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously,  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol,  between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make nearly instantaneous, emotionally charged symbols  out of something that's brand new.
Let me show you how this plays out  in a project that my firm recently completed.
We were hired to replace this building, which burned down.
This is the center of a town called the Pines  in Fire Island in New York State.
It's a vacation community.
But that meant that two years before the building was complete,  it was already a part of the community,  so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product,  there were no surprises.
This building was already a part of this community,  and then that first summer,  when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media,  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media,  because these, these are not just pictures of a building,  they're your pictures of a building.
And as you use them to tell your story,  they become part of your personal narrative,  and what you're doing is you're short-circuiting  all of our collective memory,  and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand.
That means we don't need the Greeks anymore  to tell us what to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture,  because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us,  it's changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston.
If that building was going to be built today,  the first thing they would do is go online and search "new libraries."
They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation, of innovation,  of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.
That's ammunition.
That's ammunition that they can take with them  to the mayor of Livingston, to the people of Livingston,  and say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of experimentation  gives them the freedom to run their own experiment.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures  that use big words and complicated drawings,  and you aren't the hapless public,  the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.
Architects can hear you,  and you're not intimidated by architecture.
That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth  from style to style, from movement to movement,  is irrelevant.
We can actually move forward  and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces.
This is the end of architectural history,  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow  are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.
It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville  can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works.
It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn,  not some red-brick historical pastiche  of what we think a stadium ought to be.
It means that robots are going to build our buildings,  because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.
And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature  instead of the other way around.
It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida,  can also be a place for sports  and for yoga  and you can even get married there late at night.
It means that three architects can dream about swimming  in the East River of New York,  and then raise nearly half a million dollars  from a community that gathered around their cause,  no one client anymore.
It means that no building is too small for innovation,  like this little reindeer pavilion  that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.
Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings  or a robot builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener  and smarter and friendlier.
We've just been waiting for all of you to want them.
And finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, hire an architect,  work with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world,  because the stakes are high.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society  down to the smallest spaces:  the local libraries,  the homes where we raise our children,  and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you.
This is my niece, Stella.
She's just turned one and started to walk.
And she's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do,  a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.
It is absolutely gorgeous.
And one of her favorite things to do at the moment  is to stare at herself in the mirror.
She absolutely loves her reflection.
She giggles and squeals, and gives herself these big, wet kisses.
It is beautiful.
Apparently, all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this,  and it got me thinking:  When did I stop doing this?
When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look?
Because apparently we don't.
Ten thousand people every month google,  "Am I ugly?"
This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she lives in Denver.
And like any teenager, she just wants to be liked and to fit in.
It's Sunday night.
She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.
And she's slightly dreading it, and she's a bit confused because  despite her mom telling her all the time  that she's beautiful,  every day at school, someone tells her that she's ugly.
Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends  at school, or her peers at school are telling her,  she doesn't know who to believe.
So, she takes a video of herself. She posts it to YouTube  and she asks people to please leave a comment:  "Am I pretty or am I ugly?"
Well, so far, Faye has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of them are so nasty, they don't bear thinking about.
This is an average, healthy-looking teenage girl receiving this feedback  at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this,  mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.
But what's leading them to do this?
Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available at all times,  talking, messaging, liking, commenting, sharing, posting   it never ends.
Never before have we been so connected,  so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.
And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night.
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go along with that are relentless.
This always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves  based on the number of likes they get  and the types of comments that they receive.
There's no separation between online and offline life.
What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.
And it's also really hard to tell the difference between what's authentic  and what's digitally manipulated.
What's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday.
And where are they looking to for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds  of girls today.
Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.
Airbrushing is now routine.
And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,  #bikinibridge and #proana.
For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.
These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification  of women in today's popular culture.
It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against.
But boys are not immune to this either.
Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars  and playboy music artists.
But, what's the problem with all of this?
Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, well balanced individuals.
But in an image-obsessed culture, we are training our kids  to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance  at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities.
So, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities,  and their studies and so on begin to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don't  think they look good enough.
These are not trivial activities.
These are fundamental activities to their development as humans  and as contributors to society and to the workforce.
Thirty-one percent, nearly one in three teenagers, are withdrawing  from classroom debate. They're failing  to engage in classroom debate because  they don't want to draw attention to the way that they look.
One in five are not showing up to class at all  on days when they don't feel good about it.
And when it comes to exams,  if you don't think you look good enough,  specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,  you will score a lower grade point average  than your peers who are not concerned with this.
And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.
and China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.
So to be super clear, we're talking about the  way you think you look, not how you actually look.
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement.
But it's also damaging health.
Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity,  eat less fruits and vegetables,  partake in more unhealthy weight control practices  that can lead to eating disorders.
They have lower self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by people around them  and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks  with things like alcohol and drug use;  crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; unprotected, earlier sex;  and self-harm.
The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems  and costing our governments billions of dollars every year.
And we don't grow out of it.
Women who think they're overweight  again,  regardless of whether they are or are not   have higher rates of absenteeism.
Seventeen percent of women would  not show up to a job interview on  a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.
Have a think about what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what that  opportunity looks like.
Unlocking this potential is in the interest of every single one of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.
It's not enough by itself.
If you actually want to make a difference,  you have to do something.
And we've learned there are three key ways:  The first is we have to educate for body confidence.
We have to help our teenagers develop  strategies to overcome image-related pressures  and build their self-esteem.
Now, the good news is that there are  many programs out there available to do this.
The bad news is that most of them don't work.
I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning  programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse.
So we need to make damn sure that  the programs that our kids are receiving  are not only having a positive impact,  but having a lasting impact as well.
And the research shows that the best programs  address six key areas:  The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are crucial starting points  for anyone serious about delivering  body-confidence education that works.
An education is critical,  but tackling this problem is going  to require each and everyone of us  to step up and be better role models  for the women and girls in our own lives.
Challenging the status quo of how  women are seen and talked about in our own circles.
It is not okay that we judge the contribution  of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts,  or to infer that the determination or the success  of an Olympian is down to her not being a looker.
We need to start judging people by what they do,  not what they look like.
We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures  and comments that we post on our own social networks.
We can compliment people based on their effort  and their actions and not on their appearance.
And let me ask you,  when was the last time that you kissed a mirror?
Ultimately, we need to work together as communities, as governments  and as businesses to really change this culture of ours  so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves,  valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We need to put the people that are making a real difference  on our pedestals, making a difference in the real world.
Giving them the airtime, because only then  will we create a different world.
A world where our kids are free to become  the best versions of themselves,  where the way they think they look  never holds them back from being who they are  or achieving what they want in life.
Think about what this might mean for someone in your life.
Who have you got in mind?
Is it your wife?
Your sister?
Your daughter?
Your niece?
Your friend? It could just be the woman a couple of seats away  What would it mean for her if she were freed from that voice  of her inner critic, nagging her to have  longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,  shorter feet?
What could it mean for her if we overcame this  and unlocked her potential in that way?
Right now, our culture's obsession  with image is holding us all back.
But let's show our kids the truth.
Let's show them that the way you look  is just one part of your identity  and that the truth is we love them  for who they are and what they do  and how they make us feel.
Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.
Let's each and every one of us change the way  we talk and compare ourselves to other people.
And let's work together as communities,  from grassroots to governments,  so that the happy little one-year-olds  of today become the confident changemakers of tomorrow.
Let's do this.
On November 5th, 1990,  a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked  into a hotel in Manhattan  and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,  the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,  but while serving time on lesser charges,  he and other men began planning attacks  on a dozen New York City landmarks,  including tunnels, synagogues  and the United Nations headquarters.
Thankfully, those plans were foiled  by an FBI informant.
Sadly, the 1993 bombing  of the World Trade Center was not.
Nosair would eventually be convicted  for his involvement in the plot.
El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,  and a loving American mother and grade school teacher,  who together tried their best  to create a happy childhood for me.
It wasn't until I was seven years old  that our family dynamic started to change.
My father exposed me to a side of Islam  that few people, including the majority of Muslims,  get to see.
It's been my experience that when people  take the time to interact with one another,  it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,  we all want the same things out of life.
However, in every religion, in every population,  you'll find a small percentage of people  who hold so fervently to their beliefs  that they feel they must use any means necessary  to make others live as they do.
A few months prior to his arrest,  he sat me down and explained that  for the past few weekends, he and some friends  had been going to a shooting range on Long Island  for target practice.
He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.
We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,  which unbeknownst to our group was being watched  by the FBI.
When it was my turn to shoot,  my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder  and explained how to aim at the target  about 30 yards off.
That day, the last bullet I shot  hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target  and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,  the entire target burst into flames.
My uncle turned to the other men,  and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."
Like father, like son.
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment,  but it wasn't until a few years later  that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
They thought they saw in me the same destruction  my father was capable of.
Those men would eventually be convicted  of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives  into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower,  causing an explosion that killed six people  and injured over 1,000 others.
These were the men I looked up to.
These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.
By the time I turned 19,  I had already moved 20 times in my life,  and that instability during my childhood  didn't really provide an opportunity  to make many friends.
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone,  it was time to pack up and move to the next town.
Being the perpetual new face in class,  I was frequently the target of bullies.
I kept my identity a secret from my classmates  to avoid being targeted,  but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class  was more than enough ammunition.
So for the most part, I spent my time at home  reading books and watching TV  or playing video games.
For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,  to say the least,  and growing up in a bigoted household,  I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I'd been raised to judge people  based on arbitrary measurements,  like a person's race or religion.
So what opened my eyes?
One of my first experiences  that challenged this way of thinking  was during the 2000 presidential elections.
Through a college prep program,  I was able to take part  in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
My particular group's focus was on youth violence,  and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life,  this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.
The members of our group came from many different walks of life.
One day toward the end of the convention,  I found out that one of the kids I had befriended  was Jewish.
Now, it had taken several days  for this detail to come to light,  and I realized that there was no natural animosity  between the two of us.
I had never had a Jewish friend before,  and frankly I felt a sense of pride  in having been able to overcome a barrier  that for most of my life I had been led to believe  was insurmountable.
Another major turning point came when  I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,  an amusement park.
There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures,  and that experience proved to be fundamental  to the development of my character.
Most of my life, I'd been taught  that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,  that all gay people were a negative influence.
As chance would have it, I had the opportunity  to work with some of the gay performers  at a show there,  and soon found that many were the kindest,  least judgmental people I had ever met.
Being bullied as a kid  created a sense of empathy in me  toward the suffering of others,  and it comes very unnaturally to me  to treat people who are kind  in any other way than how I would want to be treated.
Because of that feeling, I was able  to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child  with real life experience and interaction.
I don't know what it's like to be gay,  but I'm well acquainted with being judged  for something that's beyond my control.
Then there was "The Daily Show."
On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me  to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry  and helped me to realize that a person's race,  religion or sexual orientation  had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.
He was in many ways a father figure to me  when I was in desperate need of one.
Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place,  and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more  to positively influence my worldview  than my own extremist father  is not lost on me.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother  about how my worldview was starting to change,  and she said something to me  that I will hold dear to my heart  for as long as I live.
She looked at me with the weary eyes  of someone who had experienced  enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,  "I'm tired of hating people."
In that instant, I realized how much negative energy  it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.
Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
I changed it when my family decided  to end our connection with my father  and start a new life.
So why would I out myself  and potentially put myself in danger?
Well, that's simple.
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday  who is compelled to use violence  may hear my story and realize  that there is a better way,  that although I had been subjected  to this violent, intolerant ideology,  that I did not become fanaticized.
Instead, I choose to use my experience  to fight back against terrorism,  against the bigotry.
I do it for the victims of terrorism  and their loved ones,  for the terrible pain and loss  that terrorism has forced upon their lives.
For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out  against these senseless acts  and condemn my father's actions.
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof  that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,  and the son does not have to follow  the ways of his father.
I am not my father.
Thank you.   Thank you, everybody.   Thank you all.   Thanks a lot.
Right now  you have a movie playing inside your head.
It's an amazing multi-track movie.
It has 3D vision and surround sound  for what you're seeing and hearing right now,  but that's just the start of it.
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.
It has a sense of your body,  pain, hunger, orgasms.
It has emotions,  anger and happiness.
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood  playing before you.
And it has this constant voiceover narrative  in your stream of conscious thinking.
At the heart of this movie is you  experiencing all this directly.
This movie is your stream of consciousness,  the subject of experience  of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts  of human existence.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have our own inner movie,  you and you and you.
There's nothing we know about more directly.
At least, I know about my consciousness directly.
I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives  would have meaning or value.
But at the same time, it's the most  mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these inner movies?
Why aren't we just robots  who process all this input,  produce all that output,  without experiencing the inner movie at all?
Right now, nobody knows the answers  to those questions.
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness  into science, some radical ideas may be needed.
Some people say a science of consciousness  is impossible.
Science, by its nature, is objective.
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.
Psychologists studied behavior objectively,  neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,  and nobody even mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,  there was very little scientific work  on consciousness.
Now, about 20 years ago,  all that began to change.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick  and physicists like Roger Penrose  said now is the time for science  to attack consciousness.
And since then, there's been a real explosion,  a flowering of scientific work  on consciousness.
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
But it also has some fundamental  limitations so far.
The centerpiece  of the science of consciousness in recent years  has been the search for correlations,  correlations between certain areas of the brain  and certain states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of work  from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work  she presented just a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example,  the kinds of brain areas that go along with  the conscious experience of seeing faces  or of feeling pain  or of feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these brain areas  go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,  but we don't know why they do.
I like to put this by saying  that this kind of work from neuroscience  is answering some of the questions  we want answered about consciousness,  the questions about what certain brain areas do  and what they correlate with.
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.
No knock on the neuroscientists.
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.
But it doesn't address the real mystery  at the core of this subject:  why is it that all that physical processing in a brain  should be accompanied by consciousness at all?
Why is there this inner subjective movie?
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.
And you might say,  let's just give neuroscience a few years.
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon  like traffic jams, like hurricanes,  like life, and we'll figure it out.
The classical cases of emergence  are all cases of emergent behavior,  how a traffic jam behaves,  how a hurricane functions,  how a living organism reproduces  and adapts and metabolizes,  all questions about objective functioning.
You could apply that to the human brain  in explaining some of the behaviors  and the functions of the human brain  as emergent phenomena:  how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,  all these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness,  questions about behavior  are among the easy problems.
When it comes to the hard problem,  that's the question of why is it  that all this behavior  is accompanied by subjective experience?
And here, the standard paradigm  of emergence,  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,  don't really, so far, have that much to say.
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.
I want a scientific theory of consciousness  that works,  and for a long time, I banged my head  against the wall  looking for a theory of consciousness  in purely physical terms  that would work.
But I eventually came to the conclusion  that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,  we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,  chemistry explains biology,  biology explains parts of psychology.
But consciousness  doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
On the one hand, it's a datum  that we're conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how  to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.
So I think consciousness right now  is a kind of anomaly,  one that we need to integrate  into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
Faced with an anomaly like this,  radical ideas may be needed,  and I think that we may need one or two ideas  that initially seem crazy  before we can come to grips with consciousness  scientifically.
Now, there are a few candidates  for what those crazy ideas might be.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem  of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie  involves a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, all we've got to do is explain  the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,  and then we've explained everything  that needs to be explained.
Well I say, more power to him.
That's the kind of radical idea  that we need to explore  if you want to have a purely reductionist  brain-based theory of consciousness.
At the same time, for me and for many other people,  that view is a bit too close to simply  denying the datum of consciousness  to be satisfactory.
So I go in a different direction.
In the time remaining,  I want to explore two crazy ideas  that I think may have some promise.
The first crazy idea  is that consciousness is fundamental.
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe  as fundamental building blocks:  space and time and mass.
They postulate fundamental laws governing them,  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.
These fundamental properties and laws  aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.
Rather, they're taken as primitive,  and you build up the world from there.
Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out  that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena  in terms of the existing fundamentals   space, time, mass, Newton's laws   so he postulated fundamental laws  of electromagnetism  and postulated electric charge  as a fundamental element  that those laws govern.
I think that's the situation we're in  with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness  in terms of the existing fundamentals   space, time, mass, charge   then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.
The natural thing to do is to postulate  consciousness itself as something fundamental,  a fundamental building block of nature.
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.
What we then need is to study  the fundamental laws governing consciousness,  the laws that connect consciousness  to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,  physical processes.
Physicists sometimes say  that we want fundamental laws so simple  that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
Well I think something like that is the situation  we're in with consciousness.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple  we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
We don't know what those laws are yet,  but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea  is that consciousness might be universal.
Every system might have some degree  of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called panpsychism:  pan for all, psych for mind,  every system is conscious,  not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,  but even Rob Knight's microbes,  elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent  or thinking.
It's not that a photon  is wracked with angst  because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.
I never get to slow down and smell the roses."
No, not like that.
But the thought is maybe photons might have  some element of raw, subjective feeling,  some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a bit kooky to you.
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental.
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,  the way they are.
It's also worth noting that although the idea  seems counterintuitive to us,  it's much less counterintuitive to people  from different cultures,  where the human mind is seen as much more  continuous with nature.
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that  perhaps the most simple and powerful way  to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness  to physical processing  is to link consciousness to information.
Wherever there's information processing,  there's consciousness.
Complex information processing, like in a human,  complex consciousness.
Simple information processing,  simple consciousness.
A really exciting thing is in recent years  a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,  has taken this kind of theory  and developed it rigorously  with a mathematical theory.
He has a mathematical measure  of information integration  which he calls phi,  measuring the amount of information  integrated in a system.
And he supposes that phi goes along  with consciousness.
So in a human brain,  incredibly large amount of information integration,  high degree of phi,  a whole lot of consciousness.
In a mouse, medium degree of information integration,  still pretty significant,  pretty serious amount of consciousness.
But as you go down to worms,  microbes, particles,  the amount of phi falls off.
The amount of information integration falls off,  but it's still non-zero.
On Tononi's theory,  there's still going to be a non-zero degree  of consciousness.
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law  of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
Another final motivation is that  panpsychism might help us to integrate  consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed  that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality  using a bunch of equations,  but it doesn't tell us about the reality  that underlies it.
As Stephen Hawking puts it,  what puts the fire into the equations?
Well, on the panpsychist view,  you can leave the equations of physics as they are,  but you can take them to be describing  the flux of consciousness.
That's what physics really is ultimately doing,  describing the flux of consciousness.
On this view, it's consciousness  that puts the fire into the equations.
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle  outside the physical world  as some kind of extra.
It's there right at its heart.
This view, I think, the panpsychist view,  has the potential to transfigure our relationship  to nature,  and it may have some pretty serious social  and ethical consequences.
Some of these may be counterintuitive.
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything  which is conscious,  so therefore I should be vegetarian.
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,  you're going to go very hungry.
So I think when you think about it,  this tends to transfigure your views,  whereas what matters for ethical purposes  and moral considerations,  not so much the fact of consciousness,  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
It's also natural to ask about consciousness  in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificially intelligent system  in the movie "Her," Samantha?
Is she conscious?
Well, if you take the informational,  panpsychist view,  she certainly has complicated information processing  and integration,  so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
If that's right, it raises pretty serious  ethical issues about both the ethics  of developing intelligent computer systems  and the ethics of turning them off.
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness  of whole groups,  the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level,  does an integrated group  like the audience at a TED conference,  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness,  an inner movie  for this collective TED group  which is distinct from the inner movies  of each of our parts?
I don't know the answer to that question,  but I think it's at least one  worth taking seriously.
Okay, so this panpsychist vision,  it is a radical one,  and I don't know that it's correct.
I'm actually more confident about  the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental,  than about the second one,  that it's universal.
I mean, the view raises any number of questions,  has any number of challenges,  like how do those little bits  of consciousness add up  to the kind of complex consciousness  we know and love.
If we can answer those questions,  then I think we're going to be well on our way  to a serious theory of consciousness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps  in science and philosophy.
We can't expect to solve it overnight.
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,  both to understanding the universe  and to understanding ourselves.
It may just take the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a very small country town  in Victoria.
I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.
I went to school, I hung out with my friends,  I fought with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my local community  approached my parents  and wanted to nominate me  for a community achievement award.
And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
She hasn't actually achieved anything."   And they were right, you know.
I went to school, I got good marks,  I had a very low-key after school job  in my mum's hairdressing salon,  and I spent a lot of time watching  "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right, you know.
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary  at all.
I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement  if you took disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was on my second teaching round  in a Melbourne high school,  and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class  when this boy put up his hand and said,  "Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"
And I said, "What speech?"
You know, I'd been talking them  about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, like,  your motivational speaking.
You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school,  they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"
"It's usually in the big hall."
And that's when it dawned on me:  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people  as objects of inspiration.
We are not, to this kid --  and it's not his fault, I mean,  that's true for many of us.
For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers  or our doctors or our manicurists.
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I am sitting on this stage  looking like I do in this wheelchair,  and you are probably kind of expecting me  to inspire you. Right?   Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid  I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.
I am not here to inspire you.
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to  about disability.
Yeah, we've been sold the lie  that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.
It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability  makes you exceptional.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't  make you exceptional.
And in the past few years, we've been able  to propagate this lie even further  via social media.
You may have seen images like this one:  "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.
Or this one: "Before you quit, try!"
These are just a couple of examples,  but there are a lot of these images out there.
You know, you might have seen the one,  the little girl with no hands  drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
You might have seen a child running  on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
And these images,  there are lots of them out there,  they are what we call inspiration porn.
And I use the term porn deliberately,  because they objectify one group of people  for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.
The purpose of these images  is to inspire you, to motivate you,  so that we can look at them  and think, "Well, however bad my life is,  it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But what if you are that person?
I've lost count of the number of times that I've  been approached by strangers  wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave  or inspirational,  and this was long before my work  had any kind of public profile.
They were just kind of congratulating me  for managing to get up in the morning  and remember my own name.   And it is objectifying.
These images, those images  objectify disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.
They are there so that you can look at them  and think that things aren't so bad for you,  to put your worries into perspective.
And life as a disabled person  is actually somewhat difficult.
We do overcome some things.
But the things that we're overcoming  are not the things that you think they are.
They are not things to do with our bodies.
I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,  which tells us that we are more disabled  by the society that we live in  than by our bodies and our diagnoses.
So I have lived in this body a long time.
I'm quite fond of it.
It does the things that I need it to do,  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity  just as you have,  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
They are just using their bodies  to the best of their capacity.
So is it really fair to objectify them  in the way that we do,  to share those images?
People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"  they mean it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold  this lie that disability makes you exceptional.
And it honestly doesn't.
And I know what you're thinking.
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,  and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,  aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"
And the thing is, I am.
I learn from other disabled people all the time.
I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.
I am learning that it's a genius idea  to use a pair of barbecue tongs  to pick up things that you dropped.   I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge  your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.
Genius.
We are learning from each others' strength and endurance,  not against our bodies and our diagnoses,  but against a world that exceptionalizes  and objectifies us.
I really think that this lie that we've been sold  about disability is the greatest injustice.
It makes life hard for us.
And that quote, "The only disability in life  is a bad attitude,"  the reason that that's bullshit  is because it's just not true,  because of the social model of disability.
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs  has ever made it turn into a ramp.
Never.    Smiling at a television screen  isn't going to make closed captions appear  for people who are deaf.
No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop  and radiating a positive attitude  is going to turn all those books into braille.
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world  where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl  sitting in her bedroom  watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"  isn't referred to as achieving anything  because she's doing it sitting down.
I want to live in a world  where we don't have such low expectations  of disabled people  that we are congratulated for getting out of bed  and remembering our own names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement  for disabled people,  and I want to live in a world  where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school  is not one bit surprised  that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
Disability doesn't make you exceptional,  but questioning what you think you know about it does.
Thank you.
What do augmented reality  and professional football  have to do with empathy?
And what is the air speed velocity  of an unladen swallow?
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer one of those questions today,  so please, try and contain your disappointment.
When most people think about augmented reality,  they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise  waving his hands in the air,  but augmented reality is not science fiction.
Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime, and it will happen  because we have the tools to make it happen,  and people need to be aware of that,  because augmented reality will change our lives  just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.
Now how do we get to augmented reality?
Step one is the step I'm wearing right now, Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.
What you may not be familiar with  is that Google Glass is a device  that will allow you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what it is like  to be a professional athlete on the field.
Right now, the only way you can be on the field  is for me to try and describe it to you.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you then fill in  with your imagination.
With Google Glass, we can put that  underneath a helmet,  and we can get a sense of what it's like  to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,  your blood pounding in your ears.
You can get a sense of what it's like to have a 250-pound man  trying to decapitate you  with every ounce of his being.
And I've been on the receiving end of that, and it doesn't feel very good.
Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like  to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet  to give you a taste of that.
Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage  because the NFL thinks emergent technology  is what happens when a submarine surfaces,  but    we do what we can.
So let's pull up some video.
Chris Kluwe: Go.
Ugh, getting tackled sucks.
Hold on, let's get a little closer.
All right, ready?
Go!
Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,  small taste of what it's like to get tackled  on the football field  from the perspective of the tacklee.
Now, you may have noticed there are some people missing there:  the rest of the team.
We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington.
Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!
Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!
CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer  to what it's like to be on that field,  but this is nowhere what it's like  to be on the NFL.
Fans want that experience.
Fans want to be on that field. They want to be their favorite players,  and they've already talked to me on YouTube, they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,  "Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?
Can you get this on a running back?
We want that experience."
Well, once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Glass,  how do we make it more immersive? How do we take that next step?
Well, we take that step by going to something called the Oculus Rift,  which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of  the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,  and that is not empty hype.
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video.
Man: Oh! Oh!
No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!
Oh my God! Aaaah!
CK: So that is the experience of a man on a roller coaster  in fear of his life.
What do you think that fan's experience  is going to be when we take the video footage  of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,  shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm  before sprinting in for a touchdown?
What do you think that fan's experience is going to be when he's Messi sprinting down the pitch  putting the ball in the back of the net,  or Federer serving in Wimbledon?
What do you think his experience is going to be  when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour  as an Olympic downhill skier?
I think adult diaper sales may surge.
But this is not yet augmented reality.
This is only virtual reality, V.R.
How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?
We get to augmented reality  when coaches and managers and owners  look at this information streaming in that people want to see, and they say,  "How do we use this to make our teams better?
How do we use this to win games?"
Because teams always use technology to win games.
They like winning. It makes them money.
So a brief history of technology in the NFL.
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts  put a wristband on their quarterback  to allow him to call plays quicker.
They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.
Other teams followed suit.
More people watched the game because it was more exciting. It was faster.
In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios  into the helmets of the quarterbacks,  and later the defense.
More people watched games because it was faster. It was more entertaining.
In 2023, imagine you're a player walking back to the huddle,  and you have your next play displayed  right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor  that you already wear right now.
No more having to worry about forgetting plays.
No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook. You just go out and react.
And coaches really want this, because missed assignments lose you games,  and coaches hate losing games.
Losing games gets you fired as a coach.
They don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook.
Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data  and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game.
What would that be like?
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera  on each corner of the stadium looking down,  giving you a bird's-eye view of all the people down there.
You also have information from helmet sensors  and accelerometers,  technology that's being worked on right now.
You take all that information, and you stream it to your players.
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.
The bad ones have information overload.
That determines good teams from bad.
is just as important as your scouting department,  and data-mining is not for nerds anymore. It's also for jocks. Who knew?
What would that look like on the field?
Well, imagine you're the quarterback.
You take the snap and you drop back.
You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.
All of a sudden, a bright flash  on the left side of your visor lets you know,  blind side linebacker is blitzing in. Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,  but the augmented reality system lets you know. You step up into the pocket.
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.
The ball comes off track.
You don't know where it's going to land.
However, on the receiver's visor,  he sees a patch of grass light up,  and he knows to readjust.
He goes, catches the ball, sprints in, touchdown.
Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him  watching from every perspective.
Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game.
It will make tons of people watch,  because people want this experience.
Fans want to be on the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
Augmented reality will be a part of sports,  because it's too profitable not to.
But the question I ask you is,  is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for?
Are we going to use it solely for our panem,  our circenses, our entertainment as normal?
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more.
I believe we can use augmented reality  as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself,  by literally showing someone  what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes.
We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues.
It's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.
But what is this technology worth  to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bully  just how harmful his actions are  from the perspective of the victim?
What is this technology worth to a gay Ugandan or Russian  trying to show the world what it's like living under persecution?
What is this technology worth  to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson  trying to inspire a generation of children  to think more about space and science  instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality is coming.
The questions we ask, the choices we make,  and the challenges we face are, as always, up to us.
Thank you.
I recently retired  from the California Highway Patrol  after 23 years of service.
The majority of those 23 years  was spent patrolling the southern end  of Marin County,  which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure,  known worldwide  for its beautiful views of San Francisco,  the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,  being one of the most utilized sites in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.
Joseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge,  was quoted as saying,  "The bridge is practically suicide-proof.
Suicide from the bridge  is neither practical nor probable."
But since its opening,  over 1,600 people have leapt to their death  from that bridge.
Some believe that traveling  between the two towers  will lead you to another dimension --  this bridge has been romanticized as such   that the fall from that  frees you from all your worries and grief,  and the waters below  will cleanse your soul.
But let me tell you what actually occurs  when the bridge is used  as a means of suicide.
After a free fall of four to five seconds,  the body strikes the water  at about 75 miles an hour.
That impact shatters bones,  some of which then puncture vital organs.
Most die on impact.
Those that don't  generally flail in the water helplessly,  and then drown.
I don't think that those who contemplate  this method of suicide  realize how grisly a death that they will face.
This is the cord.
Except for around the two towers,  there is 32 inches of steel  paralleling the bridge.
This is where most folks stand  before taking their lives.
I can tell you from experience  that once the person is on that cord,  and at their darkest time,  it is very difficult to bring them back.
I took this photo last year  as this young woman spoke to an officer  contemplating her life.
I want to tell you very happily  that we were successful that day  in getting her back over the rail.
When I first began working on the bridge,  we had no formal training.
You struggled to funnel your way through these calls.
This was not only a disservice  to those contemplating suicide,  but to the officers as well.
We've come a long, long way since then.
Now, veteran officers and psychologists  train new officers.
This is Jason Garber.
I met Jason on July 22 of last year  when I get received a call  of a possible suicidal subject  sitting on the cord near midspan.
I responded, and when I arrived,  I observed Jason  speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.
Jason was just 32 years old  and had flown out here from New Jersey.
As a matter of fact,  he had flown out here on two other occasions  from New Jersey  to attempt suicide on this bridge.
After about an hour of speaking with Jason,  he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
Recalling your Greek mythology,  Zeus created Pandora,  and sent her down to Earth with a box,  and told her, "Never, ever open that box."
Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,  and she did open the box.
Out flew plagues, sorrows,  and all sorts of evils against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
Jason then asked us,  "What happens when you open the box  and hope isn't there?"
He paused a few moments,  leaned to his right,  and was gone.
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey  had just committed suicide.
I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,  and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,  that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,  because that very next day,  their family rabbi called to check on me.
Jason's parents had asked him to do so.
The collateral damage of suicide  affects so many people.
I pose these questions to you:  What would you do if your family member,  friend or loved one was suicidal?
What would you say?
Would you know what to say?
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,  but the listening.
Listen to understand.
Don't argue, blame,  or tell the person you know how they feel,  because you probably don't.
By just being there,  you may just be the turning point that they need.
If you think someone is suicidal,  don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.
One way of asking them the question is like this:  "Others in similar circumstances  have thought about ending their life;  have you had these thoughts?"
Confronting the person head-on  may just save their life and be the turning point for them.
Some other signs to look for:  hopelessness, believing that things are terrible  and never going to get better;  helplessness, believing that there is nothing  that you can do about it;  recent social withdrawal;  and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,  and I received an email from a lady  that I'd like to read you her letter.
She lost her son on January 19 of this year,  and she wrote this me this email  just a couple of days ago,  and it's with her permission and blessing  that I read this to you.
"Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.
That must be quite the experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.
Just wanted to drop you a note.
Hope you get the word out to many people  and they go home talking about it  to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty numb,  but noticing more moments of really realizing  Mike isn't coming home.
Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco  to watch the 49ers game with his father  on January 19.
He never made it there.
I called Petaluma police  and reported him missing that evening.
The next morning,  two officers came to my home  and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge  at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.
Thanks so much  for standing up for those  who may be only temporarily too weak  to stand for themselves.
Who hasn't been low before  without suffering from a true mental illness?
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,  is supposed to be a passage across  our beautiful bay,  not a graveyard.
Good luck this week. Vicky."
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her  to go down to that bridge and walk the path  that her son took that day,  and also the courage just to carry on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man  I refer to as hope and courage.
On March 11 of 2005,  I responded to a radio call of a possible  suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk  near the north tower.
I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk  and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,  standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he immediately traversed  that pedestrian rail,  and stood on that small pipe  which goes around the tower.
For the next hour and a half,  I listened as Kevin spoke about  his depression and hopelessness.
Kevin decided on his own that day  to come back over that rail  and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back over,  I congratulated him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it  that made you come back  and give hope and life another chance?"
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You listened.
You let me speak, and you just listened."
Shortly after this incident,  I received a letter from Kevin's mother,  and I have that letter with me,  and I'd like to read it to you.
"Dear Mr. Briggs,  Nothing will erase the events of March 11,  but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness  for which he has been properly medicated.
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,  completely unaware of any hereditary traits,  but, thank God, now we know.
Kevin is straight, as he says.
We truly thank God for you.
Sincerely indebted to you,  Narvella Berthia."
And on the bottom she writes,  "P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening,  you were listed as the patient.
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."
Today, Kevin is a loving father  and contributing member of society.
He speaks openly  about the events that day and his depression  in the hopes that his story  will inspire others.
Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.
It's personal.
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
That act, although ending his own pain,  robbed me from ever getting to know him.
This is what suicide does.
For most suicidal folks,  or those contemplating suicide,  they wouldn't think of hurting another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:  sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
In my career, I've responded to  and been involved in hundreds  of mental illness and suicide calls  around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,  I've only lost two,  but that's two too many.
One was Jason.
The other was a man I spoke to  for about an hour.
During that time, he shook my hand  on three occasions.
On that final handshake,  he looked at me, and he said,  "Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And he leapt.
Horrible, absolutely horrible.
I do want to tell you, though,  the vast majority of folks  that we do get to contact on that bridge  do not commit suicide.
Additionally, that very few  who have jumped off the bridge and lived  and can talk about it,  that one to two percent,  most of those folks have said  that the second that they let go of that rail,  they knew that they had made a mistake  and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects  Marin to San Francisco,  but people together also.
That connection, or bridge that we make,  is something that each and every one of us  should strive to do.
Suicide is preventable.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you something that you're not,  but you know inside what you are,  and that question burns in your heart:  How will you become that?
I may be somewhat unique in this,  but I am not alone,  not alone at all.
So when I became a fashion model,  I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream  that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.
My outside self finally matched my inner truth,  my inner self.
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,  when I look at this picture,  at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,  you've made it,  you have arrived.
But this past October,  I realized that I'm only just beginning.
All of us are put in boxes by our family,  by our religion,  by our society,  our moment in history,  even our own bodies.
Some people have the courage to break free,  not to accept the limitations imposed by  the color of their skin  or by the beliefs of those that surround them.
Those people are always the threat  to the status quo,  to what is considered acceptable.
In my case, for the last nine years,  some of my neighbors,  some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,  did not know about my history.
I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.
Here is mine.
I was assigned boy at birth  based on the appearance of my genitalia.
I remember when I was five years old  in the Philippines walking around our house,  I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me,  "How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"
I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."
I knew then how to self-identify.
Gender has always been considered a fact,  immutable,  but we now know it's actually more fluid,  complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never had the courage  to share my story,  not because I thought what I am is wrong,  but because of how the world treats those of us  who wish to break free.
Every day,  I am so grateful because I am a woman.
I have a mom and dad and family  who accepted me for who I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in Asian culture  that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.
So when I was eight years old,  I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating  these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage,  and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman  right in front of me,  and I remember that moment something hit me:  That is the kind of woman I would like to be.
So when I was 15 years old,  still dressing as a boy,  I met this woman named T.L.
She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.
That night she asked me,  "How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"
She convinced me that if I joined  that she would take care of the registration fee  and the garments,  and that night,  I won best in swimsuit  and best in long gown  and placed second runner up among 40-plus candidates.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was introduced to the world of beauty pageants.
Not a lot of people could say that your first job  is a pageant queen for transgender women,  but I'll take it.
I also experienced the goodness of strangers,  especially when we would travel  in remote provinces in the Philippines.
But most importantly, I met  some of my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,  called me and told me that my green card petition came through,  that I could now move to the United States.
I resisted it.
I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.
I'm here with my friends,  I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."
But then two weeks later she called me, she said,  "Did you know that if you move to the United States  you could change your name and gender marker?"
That was all I needed to hear.
My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name.
She also came with me when I had my surgery  in Thailand at 19 years old.
It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand,  they perform some of the most prestigious, safe and sophisticated surgery.
At that time in the United States,  you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker.
So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,  and I remember looking at my California driver's license  with the name Geena and gender marker F.
That was a powerful moment.
For some people,  their I.D. is their license to drive  or even to get a drink,  but for me, that was my license to live,  to feel dignified.
All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.
I felt that I could conquer my dream  and move to New York and be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.
She's from New York, she's a young woman  who was courageously living her truth,  but hatred ended her life.
For most of my community,  this is the reality in which we live.
Our suicide rate is nine times higher  than that of the general population.
Every November 20, we have a global vigil  for Transgender Day of Remembrance.
I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought  and stood up for injustice.
This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
Today, this very moment, is my real coming out.
I could no longer live my truth for and by myself.
I want to do my best to help others  live their truth without shame and terror.
I am here, exposed,  so that one day there will never be a need for a November 20 vigil.
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.   Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.
Geena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.
The support system, with my mom especially,  and my family, that in itself  is just so powerful.
I remember every time I would coach  young trans women, I would mentor them,  and sometimes when they would call me  and tell me that their parents can't accept it,  I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,  "Mom, can you call this woman?"
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so   But it's just, gender identity  is in the core of our being, right?
I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,  so what I'm trying to do  is to have this conversation that  sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,  and there should be a space  that would allow people to self-identify,  and that's a conversation that we should have  with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement,  it's at the very beginning,  to compare to how the gay movement started.
There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
There should be an understanding.
There should be a space of curiosity  and asking questions,  and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.
KS: Thank you. That was so lovely. GR: Thank you.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,  fathers are usually known by their sons,  but I'm one of the few fathers  who is known by his daughter,  and I am proud of it.
Malala started her campaign for education  and stood for her rights in 2007,  and when her efforts were honored in 2011,  and she was given the national youth peace prize,  and she became a very famous,  very popular young girl of her country.
Before that, she was my daughter,  but now I am her father.
Ladies and gentlemen,  if we glance to human history,  the story of women  is the story of injustice,  inequality,  violence and exploitation.
You see,  in patriarchal societies,  right from the very beginning,  when a girl is born,  her birth is not celebrated.
She is not welcomed,  neither by father nor by mother.
The neighborhood comes  and commiserates with the mother,  and nobody congratulates the father.
And a mother is very uncomfortable  for having a girl child.
When she gives birth to the first girl child,  first daughter, she is sad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter,  she is shocked,  and in the expectation of a son,  when she gives birth to a third daughter,  she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffers,  but the daughter, the newly born daughter,  when she grows old,  she suffers too.
At the age of five,  while she should be going to school,  she stays at home  and her brothers are admitted in a school.
Until the age of 12, somehow,  she has a good life.
She can have fun.
She can play with her friends in the streets,  and she can move around in the streets  like a butterfly.
But when she enters her teens,  when she becomes 13 years old,  she is forbidden to go out of her home  without a male escort.
She is confined under the four walls of her home.
She is no more a free individual.
She becomes the so-called honor  of her father and of her brothers  and of her family,  and if she transgresses  the code of that so-called honor,  she could even be killed.
And it is also interesting that this so-called  code of honor,  it does not only affect the life of a girl,  it also affects the life  of the male members of the family.
So this brother,  he sacrifices the joys of his life  and the happiness of his sisters  at the altar of so-called honor.
And there is one more norm  of the patriarchal societies  that is called obedience.
A good girl is supposed to be  very quiet, very humble  and very submissive.
It is the criteria.
The role model good girl should be very quiet.
She is supposed to be silent  and she is supposed to accept the decisions  of her father and mother  and the decisions of elders,  even if she does not like them.
If she is married to a man she doesn't like  or if she is married to an old man,  she has to accept,  because she does not want to be dubbed  as disobedient.
If she is married very early,  she has to accept.
Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a poetess,  she is wedded, bedded,  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.
And it is the irony of the situation  that this mother,  she teaches the same lesson of obedience  to her daughter  and the same lesson of honor to her sons.
And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,  and for the first time,  believe me,  I don't like newborn children, to be honest,  but when I went and I looked into her eyes,  believe me,  I got extremely honored.
And long before she was born,  I thought about her name,  and I was fascinated with a heroic  legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,  and I named my daughter after her.
But when I looked, all were men,  and I picked my pen,  drew a line from my name,  and wrote, "Malala."
And when she grow old,  when she was four and a half years old,  I admitted her in my school.
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about  the admission of a girl in a school?
Yes, I must mention it.
It may be taken for granted in Canada,  in America, in many developed countries,  but in poor countries,  in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,  it's a big event for the life of girl.
Enrollment in a school means  recognition of her identity and her name.
Admission in a school means  that she has entered the world of dreams  and aspirations  where she can explore her potentials  for her future life.
I have five sisters,  and none of them could go to school,  and you will be astonished,  two weeks before,  when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,  and I was filling out the family part of the form,  I could not recall  the surnames of some of my sisters.
And the reason was  that I have never, never seen the names  of my sisters written on any document.
That was the reason that  I valued my daughter.
What my father could not give to my sisters  and to his daughters,  I thought I must change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence  and the brilliance of my daughter.
I encouraged her to sit with me  when my friends used to come.
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.
And all these good values,  I tried to inculcate in her personality.
And this was not only she, only Malala.
I imparted all these good values  to my school, girl students and boy students as well.
I used education for emancipation.
I taught my girls,  I taught my girl students,  to unlearn the lesson of obedience.
I taught my boy students  to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
Dear brothers and sisters,  we were striving for more rights for women,  and we were struggling to have more,  more and more space for the women in society.
But we came across a new phenomenon.
It was lethal to human rights  and particularly to women's rights.
It was called Talibanization.
It means a complete negation  of women's participation  in all political, economical and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were prohibited from going to school.
Women were forced to wear veils  and they were stopped from going to the markets.
Musicians were silenced,  girls were flogged  and singers were killed.
Millions were suffering,  but few spoke,  and it was the most scary thing  when you have all around such people  who kill and who flog,  and you speak for your rights.
It's really the most scary thing.
At the age of 10,  Malala stood, and she stood for the right  of education.
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,  she volunteered herself  for the New York Times documentaries,  and she spoke from every platform she could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban  could not tolerate her campaign,  and on October 9 2012,  she was shot in the head at point blank range.
It was a doomsday for my family and for me.
The world turned into a big black hole.
While my daughter was  on the verge of life and death,  I whispered into the ears of my wife,  "Should I be blamed for what happened  to my daughter and your daughter?"
And she abruptly told me,  "Please don't blame yourself.
You stood for the right cause.
You put your life at stake  for the cause of truth,  for the cause of peace,  and for the cause of education,  and your daughter in inspired from you  and she joined you.
You both were on the right path  and God will protect her."
These few words meant a lot to me,  and I didn't ask this question again.
When Malala was in the hospital,  and she was going through the severe pains  and she had had severe headaches  because her facial nerve was cut down,  I used to see a dark shadow  spreading on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
She used to tell us,  "I'm fine with my crooked smile  and with my numbness in my face.
I'll be okay. Please don't worry."
She was a solace for us,  and she consoled us.
Dear brothers and sisters,  we learned from her how to be resilient  in the most difficult times,  and I'm glad to share with you  that despite being an icon  for the rights of children and women,  she is like any 16-year old girl.
She cries when her homework is incomplete.
She quarrels with her brothers,  and I am very happy for that.
People ask me,  what special is in my mentorship  which has made Malala so bold  and so courageous and so vocal and poised?
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I had brain surgery 18 years ago,  and since that time, brain science has become  a personal passion of mine.
I'm actually an engineer.
And first let me say, I recently joined  where I had a division,  the display division in Google X,  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today  is work I did before I joined Google  and on the side outside of Google.
So that said, there's a stigma  when you have brain surgery.
Are you still smart or not?
And if not, can you make yourself smart again?
After my neurosurgery,  part of my brain was missing,  and I had to deal with that.
It wasn't the grey matter, but it was the gooey part dead center  that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.
Immediately after my surgery,  I had to decide what amounts of each of over  a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,  because if I just took nothing,  I would die within hours.
Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --  I've had to try to decide the combinations  and mixtures of chemicals,  and try to get them, to stay alive.
There have been several close calls.
But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,  so I decided I would experiment  to try to find more optimal dosages  because there really isn't a clear road map  on this that's detailed.
I began to try different mixtures,  and I was blown away by how  tiny changes in dosages  dramatically changed my sense of self,  my sense of who I was, my thinking,  my behavior towards people.
One particularly dramatic case:  for a couple months I actually tried dosages  and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.
I was angry all the time,  I thought about sex constantly,  and I thought I was the smartest person  in the entire world, and    of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that,  or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.
I was kind of extreme.
But to me, the surprise was,  I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
I was actually trying,  with a little bit of insecurity,  to actually fix a problem in front of me,  and it just didn't come out that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dosages.
But that experience, I think, gave me  a new appreciation for men  and what they might walk through,  and I've gotten along with men  a lot better since then.
What I was trying to do  with tuning these hormones  and neurotransmitters and so forth  was to try to get my intelligence back  after my illness and surgery,  my creative thought, my idea flow.
And I think mostly in images,  and so for me that became a key metric --  how to get these mental images  that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,  if you will, my ideas,  trying on different new ideas for size,  playing out scenarios.
This kind of thinking isn't new.
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes  saw things similarly.
They thought that mental images and ideas  were actually the same thing.
There are those today that dispute that,  and lots of debates about how the mind works,  but for me it's simple:  Mental images, for most of us,  are central in inventive and creative thinking.
So after several years,  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication  and the analytical backbone behind them.
And so now I'm working on,  how can I get these mental images in my mind  out to my computer screen faster?
Can you imagine, if you will,  a movie director being able to use  her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this  as a way for creative people  to share at light speed.
And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck  in being able to do this  is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there  by sharing with you two recent experiments  from two top neuroscience groups.
Both used fMRI technology --  functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --  to image the brain,  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis  and his colleagues at Harvard.
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan  of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the brainscan  of that same individual  imagining, seeing that same image.
And the right column was created  by subtracting the middle column from the left column,  showing the difference to be nearly zero.
This was repeated on lots of different individuals  with lots of different images,  always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image  and imagining seeing that same image  is next to nothing.
Next let me share with you one other experiment,  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.
They've been able to decode brainwaves  into recognizable visual fields.
So let me set this up for you.
In this experiment, individuals were shown  hundreds of hours of YouTube videos  while scans were made of their brains  to create a large library of their brain reacting  to video sequences.
Then a new movie was shown with new images,  new people, new animals in it,  and a new scan set was recorded.
The computer, using brain scan data alone,  decoded that new brain scan  to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.
On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,  and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.
This is the jaw-dropper.
We are so close to being able to do this.
We just need to up the resolution.
And now remember that when you see an image  versus when you imagine that same image,  it creates the same brain scan.
So this was done with the highest-resolution  brain scan systems available today,  and their resolution has increased really  about a thousandfold in the last several years.
Next we need to increase the resolution  another thousandfold  to get a deeper glimpse.
How do we do that?
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.
I'm not for that.
There's a lot of new imaging techniques  being proposed, some even by me,  but given the recent success of MRI,  first we need to ask the question,  is it the end of the road with this technology?
Conventional wisdom says the only way  to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,  but at this point bigger magnets  only offer incremental resolution improvements,  not the thousandfold we need.
I'm putting forward an idea:  instead of bigger magnets,  let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complicated structures  with slightly different arrangements,  kind of like making Spirograph.
So why does that matter?
A lot of effort in MRI over the years  has gone into making really big,  really huge magnets, right?
But yet most of the recent advances  in resolution have actually come from  ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions  in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers  in the MRI systems.
Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,  put down structured magnetic patterns  in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.
So by combining the magnetics patterns  with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies  processing which can massively increase  the information that we can extract  in a single scan.
And on top of that, we can then layer  our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory  to create a thousandfold increase that we need.
And using fMRI, we should be able to measure  not just oxygenated blood flow,  but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about  and maybe even the direct neural activity,  which is the dream.
We're going to be able to dump our ideas  directly to digital media.
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language  and communicate directly with human thought?
What would we be capable of then?
And how will we learn to deal  with the truths of unfiltered human thought?
You think the Internet was big.
These are huge questions.
It might be irresistible as a tool  to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
And indeed, this very same tool  may prove to lead to the cure  for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have little option but to open this door.
Regardless, pick a year --  will it happen in five years or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight  about coming out of the closet,  and not in the traditional sense,  not just the gay closet.
I think we all have closets.
Your closet may be telling someone  you love her for the first time,  or telling someone that you're pregnant,  or telling someone you have cancer,  or any of the other hard conversations  we have throughout our lives.
All a closet is is a hard conversation,  and although our topics may vary tremendously,  the experience of being in  and coming out of the closet is universal.
It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.
Several years ago,  I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,  a local diner in town,  and during my time there I would go through phases  of militant lesbian intensity:  not shaving my armpits,  quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.
And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts  and how recently I had shaved my head,  the question would often be sprung on me,  usually by a little kid:  "Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"
And there would be an awkward silence at the table.
I'd clench my jaw a little tighter,  hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.
The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper  and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.
But I would say nothing,  and I would seethe inside.
And it got to the point where every time I walked up  to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that is a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready,  and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101  on this table.   I've got my Betty Friedan quotes.
I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.
I've even got this little bit from "Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.
So I take a deep breath and I look down  and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress,  not a challenge to a feminist duel,  just a kid with a question:  "Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
So I take another deep breath,  squat down to next to her, and say,  "Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.
My hair is short like a boy's,  and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,  and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress,  and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies?
Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."
And this kid looks me dead in the eye,  without missing a beat, and says,  "My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.
Can I get a pancake, please?"
And that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.
How about that pancake?"
It was the easiest hard conversation  I have ever had.
And why? Because Pancake Girl and I,  we were both real with each other.
So like many of us,  I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,  most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.
But inside, in the dark,  you can't tell what color the walls are.
You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.
So really, my closet is no different than yours  or yours or yours.
Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons  why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours,  but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.
Hard is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy  is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them?
Who can tell me that his coming out story  is harder than telling your five-year-old you're getting a divorce?
There is no harder, there is just hard.
We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard  to make us feel better or worse about our closets  and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in closets,  and they may feel safe,  or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.
But I am here to tell you,  no matter what your walls are made of,  a closet is no place for a person to live.
Thanks.   So imagine yourself 20 years ago.
Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,  and high-heeled shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian  ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.
I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner  of my pitch-black closet  clutching my gay grenade,  and moving one muscle is the scariest thing  I have ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers --  I had spent my entire life  trying to not disappoint these people,  and now I was turning the world upside down  on purpose.
I was burning the pages of the script  we had all followed for so long,  but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade tosses  was at my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many in attendance  knew I was gay, so in doing my maid of honor duties,  in my black dress and heels,  I walked around to tables  and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,  folks that had known me for years.
And after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out,  "I love Nathan Lane!"
And the battle of gay relatability had begun.
"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"
"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco."
"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous."
"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?
He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend."
"Ash, what's your favorite TV show?
Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace.
And you know who we love? Jack.
Jack is our favorite."
And then one woman, stumped  but wanting so desperately to show her support,  to let me know she was on my side,  she finally blurted out,  "Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."
And I had a choice in that moment,  as all grenade throwers do.
Sure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short.
It's a lot harder to meet them where they are  and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.
And what else can you ask someone to do but try?
If you're going to be real with someone,  you gotta be ready for real in return.
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
Ask anybody I have ever dated.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call  the three Pancake Girl principles.
Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses,  but know what it takes to come out of any closet  is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor off. Be yourself.
That kid in the cafe had no armor,  but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be real with you,  they need to know that you bleed too.
Number two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.
If you know you are gay, just say it.
If you tell your parents you might be gay,  they will hold out hope that this will change.
Do not give them that sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important --    Be unapologetic.
You are speaking your truth.
Never apologize for that.
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,  so sure, apologize for what you've done,  but never apologize for who you are.
And yeah, some folks may be disappointed,  but that is on them, not on you.
Those are their expectations of who you are, not yours.
That is their story, not yours.
The only story that matters  is the one that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself  in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,  know we have all been there before.
And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night.
Intelligence -- what is it?
If we take a look back at the history  of how intelligence has been viewed,  one seminal example has been  Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  "the question of whether a machine can think  is about as interesting  as the question of whether a submarine  can swim."
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,  intended it as a criticism  of the early pioneers of computer science,  like Alan Turing.
And so, several years ago,  I undertook a program to try to understand  the fundamental physical mechanisms  underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.
Pretend that you're an alien race  that doesn't know anything about Earth biology  or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,  but you have amazing telescopes  and you're able to watch the Earth,  and you have amazingly long lives,  so you're able to watch the Earth  over millions, even billions of years.
And you observe a really strange effect.
Now of course, as earthlings,  we know the reason would be  that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to prevent an impact.
But if you're an alien race  who doesn't know any of this,  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,  you'd be forced to put together  a physical theory that explains how,  up until a certain point in time,  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet  mysteriously stop doing that.
And so I claim that this is the same question  as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I undertook several years ago,  I looked at a variety of different threads  across science, across a variety of disciplines,  that were pointing, I think,  towards a single, underlying mechanism  for intelligence.
In cosmology, for example,  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence  that our universe appears to be finely tuned  for the development of intelligence,  and, in particular, for the development  of universal states  that maximize the diversity of possible futures.
Finally, in robotic motion planning,  there have been a variety of recent techniques  that have tried to take advantage  of abilities of robots to maximize  future freedom of action  in order to accomplish complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different threads  and putting them together,  I asked, starting several years ago,  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence  that we can factor out  of all of these different threads?
Is there a single equation for intelligence?
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T  S"]  What you're seeing is probably  the closest equivalent to an E = mc  for intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here  is a statement of correspondence  that intelligence is a force, F,  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action,  or keep options open,  with some strength T,  with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,  up to some future time horizon, tau.
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action  and keep options open.
And so, given this one equation,  it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
Does it predict human-level intelligence?
Does it predict artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video  that will, I think, demonstrate  some of the amazing applications  of just this single equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology  has suggested that universes that produce  more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes  should tend to have more favorable conditions  for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.
But what if that tentative cosmological connection  between entropy and intelligence  hints at a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate  with the production of long-term entropy,  but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine  called Entropica, designed to maximize  the production of long-term entropy  of any system that it finds itself in.
Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass  multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games,  and even earn money trading stocks,  all without being instructed to do so.
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.
Just like a human standing upright without falling over,  here we see Entropica  automatically balancing a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part  because we never gave Entropica a goal.
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.
This balancing ability will have appliactions  for humanoid robotics  and human assistive technologies.
This tool use ability will have applications  for smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just as some other animals  are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope  at the same time to release food,  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish  a model version of that task.
This cooperative ability has interesting implications  for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Entropica is broadly applicable  to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully  playing a game of pong against itself,  illustrating its potential for gaming.
Here we see Entropica orchestrating  new connections on a social network  where friends are constantly falling out of touch  and successfully keeping the network well connected.
This same network orchestration ability  also has applications in health care,  energy, and intelligence.
Here we see Entropica directing the paths  of a fleet of ships,  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal  to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic  to the Pacific.
By the same token, Entropica  is broadly applicable to problems  in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Entropica  spontaneously discovering and executing  a buy-low, sell-high strategy  on a simulated range traded stock,  successfully growing assets under management  exponentially.
This risk management ability  will have broad applications in finance  and insurance.
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen  is that a variety of signature human intelligent  cognitive behaviors  such as tool use and walking upright  and social cooperation  all follow from a single equation,  which drives a system  to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, there's a profound irony here.
Going back to the beginning  of the usage of the term robot,  the play "RUR,"  there was always a concept  that if we developed machine intelligence,  there would be a cybernetic revolt.
The machines would rise up against us.
One major consequence of this work  is that maybe all of these decades,  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt  in reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent  and then megalomaniacal  and try to take over the world.
It's quite the opposite,  that the urge to take control  of all possible futures  is a more fundamental principle  than that of intelligence,  that general intelligence may in fact emerge  directly from this sort of control-grabbing,  rather than vice versa.
Another important consequence is goal seeking.
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals  follow from this sort of framework?
My equivalent of that statement  to pass on to descendants  to help them build artificial intelligences  or to help them understand human intelligence,  is the following:  Intelligence should be viewed  as a physical process  that tries to maximize future freedom of action  and avoid constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history,  a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.
Even in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded  our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe.
NASA's Kepler mission has discovered  thousands of potential planets around other stars,  indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope  that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them,  blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.
Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes  as well as their distance from their parent star.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky,  like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System,  and also how much light they receive from their parent sun.
In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover  might be habitable or not.
Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove  of potentially habitable worlds,  our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hottest year on record.
Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia  are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion  are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer.
I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars  with the hopes of finding the places in the universe  where we might discover life beyond our own planet.
You could say that I look for choice alien real estate.
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe,  I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth,  the more you appreciate our own planet itself.
Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison  between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best:  those of our own Solar System.
Consider our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun,  it might be considered a potentially habitable world  if found by a mission like Kepler.
Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past,  and in part, this is why we study Mars so much.
Our rovers, like Curiosity, crawl across its surface,  scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it.
Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere,  trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability.
Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space  but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars.
But though these Martian vistas  resemble the deserts of our own home world,  places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,  compared to Earth  Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Consider the extent to which we have not colonized  the deserts of our own planet,  places that are lush by comparison with Mars.
Even in the driest, highest places on Earth,  the air is sweet and thick with oxygen  exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests.
I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets  carries with it a long, dark shadow:  the implication and belief by some  that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction  of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth.
As much as I love interplanetary exploration,  I deeply disagree with this idea.
There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars,  but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity  is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party      Thank you.
But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation  are not opposed to one another.
No, they're in fact two sides of the same goal:  to understand, preserve and improve life into the future.
The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces  out of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth,  perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment  and moving beyond it.
I leave you with a final thought experiment:  Fermi's paradox.
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact  that our universe has been around for a very long time  and we expect that there are many planets within it,  we should have found evidence for alien life by now.
So where are they?
Well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox  is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough  to consider living amongst the stars,  they lose sight of how important it is  to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with.
It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone  will save us from ourselves,  but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration  can work together.
If we truly believe in our ability  to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation,  then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving  the habitability of the Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I broke into my own house.
And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,  I found I didn't have my keys.
In fact, I could see them through the window,  lying on the dining room table where I had left them.
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,  and they were locked tight.
I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone,  but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,  and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night  because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,  and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.
This was going to be expensive,  but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,  so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training  and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.
It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,  it modulates adrenaline levels  and it clouds your thinking.
And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,  that I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do,  systems that I can put into place,  that will prevent bad things from happening?
Or at least if bad things happen,  will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that,  but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,  and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,  and, you know, forgotten my passport,  and Danny shared with me  that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,  who had written about it a few years before,  also called the pre-mortem.
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.
Whenever there's a disaster,  a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,  you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,  and then you try to figure out what you can do  to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about today  are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.
Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.
I'll start with the obvious ones.
Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.
Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is,  but there's a lot of science to back this up,  based on the way our spatial memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,  that evolved over tens of thousands of years,  to keep track of the locations of important things --  where the well is, where fish can be found,  that stand of fruit trees,  where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain  that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.
It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment  where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,  and they could still find their nuts.
They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,  this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.
But it's really good for things that don't move around much,  not so good for things that move around.
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.
So in the home, designate a spot for your keys --  a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.
For your passport, a particular drawer.
For your reading glasses, a particular table.
If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,  your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about travel?
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards,  your driver's license, your passport,  mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.
Now these are some rather obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem  is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,  and you should put systems in place.
And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation  than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,  where we have to make a very important decision  about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,  to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,  and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making --  any kind of decision you have to make  that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,  "I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."
Now, you all know that high cholesterol  is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,  heart attack, stroke.
And so you're thinking  having high cholesterol isn't the best thing,  and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug  that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."
And you've probably heard of statins,  you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs  in the world today,  you probably even know people who take them.
And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."
But there's a question you should ask at this point,  a statistic you should ask for  that most doctors don't like talking about,  and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.
It's for the number needed to treat.
Now, what is this, the NNT?
It's the number of people that need to take a drug  or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure  before one person is helped.
And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?
The number should be one.
My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me  if it's not going to help.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the doctor's fault,  if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.
We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates  that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,  what do you suppose it is?
How many people have to take it before one person is helped?
300.
This is according to research  by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,  independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
I ran through the numbers myself.
300 people have to take the drug for a year  before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.
Now you're probably thinking,  "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.
Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."
But you should ask at this point for another statistic,  and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?
So for this particular drug,  the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And they include terrible things --  debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress --  but now you're thinking, "Five percent,  not very likely it's going to happen to me,  I'll still take the drug."
But wait a minute.
Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly.
So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,  so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,  five percent of those 300 have side effects,  that's 15 people.
You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug  than you are to be helped by the drug.
Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.
I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethics requires it,  it's part of the principle of informed consent.
You have the right to have access to this kind of information  to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Now you might be thinking  I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,  but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,  removal of the prostate for cancer,  the number needed to treat is 49.
That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.
They include impotence, erectile dysfunction,  urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,  fecal incontinence.
And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,  they'll only last for a year or two.
So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time  to the questions that you might be able to ask  that will push the conversation forward.
You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.
And you also want to think about things like quality of life.
Because you have a choice oftentimes,  do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,  or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?
These are things to talk about and think about now,  with your family and your loved ones.
You might change your mind in the heat of the moment,  but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,  and one of the things that happens at that moment  is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,  or your libido, or your immune system,  because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things  and you don't react quickly,  you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.
Unfortunately,  one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress  is rational, logical thinking,  as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead  to these kinds of situations.
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
We all are going to fail now and then.
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,  to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,  or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.
Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal,  when I got back from my trip,  I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,  with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.
And I have to admit,  I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,  and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.
So I'm not completely organized,  but I see organization as a gradual process,  and I'm getting there.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Piano, "p," is my favorite musical symbol.
It means to play softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score,  you need to play softer.
Two p's -- even softer.
Four p's -- extremely soft.
This is my drawing of a p-tree,  which demonstrates  no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be,  you'll never reach complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence:  a very obscure sound.
I'd like to share a little bit  about the history of American Sign Language, ASL,  plus a bit of my own background.
French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s,  and as time went by, mixed with local signs,  it evolved into the language we know today as ASL.
So it has a history of about 200 years.
I was born deaf,  and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I believed it to be true.
Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.
Sound was very much a part of my life,  really, on my mind every day.
As a Deaf person living in a world of sound,  it's as if I was living in a foreign country,  blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms  without ever questioning them.
So how is it that I understand sound?
Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.
You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound.
I learn and mirror that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I create sound,  and I've seen how people respond to me.
Thus I've learned, for example ...
"Don't slam the door!"
"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
"Don't burp,  and when you're eating,  make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate."
All of these things I term "sound etiquette."
Maybe I think about sound etiquette  more than the average hearing person does.
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.
And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation  around sound, about what's to come next.
Hence, this drawing.
TBD, to be decided.
TBC, to be continued.
TBA, to be announced.
And you notice the staff --  there are no notes contained in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound  through the subtle smudges and smears.
In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.
A typical staff contains five lines.
Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that  doesn't feel natural.
That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany,  for an artist residency there.
Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter.
During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces,  and as I went from one place to the next,  I noticed there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ...
there was no visual art,  everything was auditory.
Now sound has come into my art territory.
Is it going to further distance me from art?
I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.
I actually know sound.
I know it so well  that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.
It could be felt tactually,  or experienced as a visual,  or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound  and to put it into my art practice.
And everything that I had been taught regarding sound,  I decided to do away with and unlearn.
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I presented this to the art community,  I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received.
I realized:  sound is like money,  power, control --  social currency.
In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing,  a hearing person's thing.
And sound is so powerful  that it could either disempower me and my artwork,  or it could empower me.
I chose to be empowered.
There's a massive culture around spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate,  in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal  and become my voice.
And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.
So at school, at work and institutions,  I work with many different ASL interpreters.
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be heard.
And their voices hold value and currency.
Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,  I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency,  kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I didn't continue this practice,  I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion  and not maintain any form of social currency.
So with sound as my new art medium,  I delved into the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL.
For example,  a musical note  cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.
And the same holds true for a concept in ASL.
They're both highly spatial and highly inflected --  meaning that subtle changes  can affect the entire meaning  of both signs and sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor,  to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works.
So, envision a piano.
ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters.
If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano --  such as facial expression, body movement,  speed, hand shape and so on,  as you play the piano --  English is a linear language,  as if one key is being pressed at a time.
However, ASL is more like a chord --  all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously  to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.
If just one of those keys were to change the chord,  it would create a completely different meaning.
The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters,  you can express different ideas.
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
I'm looking at you.
Staring at you.
Oh -- busted.
Uh-oh.
What are you looking at?
Aw, stop.
I then started thinking,  "What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?"
If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over,  it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign for "day,"  as the sun rises and sets.
This is "all day."
If I was to repeat it and slow it down,  visually it looks like a piece of music.
All ... day.
I feel the same holds true for "all night."
"All night."
This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing.
And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights:  "last night,"  "overnight,"   "all night long."
I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in ASL  and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.
For example,  1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,  present tense happens closest and in front of the body,  future is in front of the body and the past is to your back.
So, the first example is "a long time ago."
Then "past,"  "used to"  and the last one, which is my favorite,  with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it,  "once upon a time."
"Common time"  is a musical term  with a specific time signature of four beats per measure.
Yet when I see the word "common time,"  what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time."
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.
We have the staff across the head and the chest.
[Head: RH, Flash claw]  [Common time]  [Chest: LH, Flash claw]  I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw."
Can you please follow along with me?
Everybody, hands up.
Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest,  kind of like "common time" or at the same time.
Yes, got it.
That means "to fall in love" in International [Sign].
International [Sign], as a note,  is a visual tool to help communicate  across cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this --  please follow along with me again.
And now this.
This is "colonization" in ASL.
Now the third --  please follow along again.
And again.
This is "enlightenment" in ASL.
So let's do all three together.
"Fall in love,"  "colonization"  and "enlightenment."
Good job, everyone.
Notice how all three signs are very similar,  they all happen at the head and the chest,  but they convey quite different meanings.
So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving,  just like music is.
However, in this day and age,  we live in a very audio-centric world.
And just because ASL has no sound to it,  it automatically holds no social currency.
We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency  and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency --  without sound.
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand  that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL,  nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
ASL is such a rich treasure  that I'd like you to have the same experience.
And I'd like to invite you to open your ears,  to open your eyes,  take part in our culture  and experience our visual language.
And you never know,  you might just fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.
When I was a kid, my parents would tell me,  "You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself."
So freedom came with responsibility.
But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places,  where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --  or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,  because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.
And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess,  and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.
Fast forward, I am an adult now,  and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School.
And it doesn't take too long  before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash.
So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches --  and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.
And so it's sad to say,  but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them.
It's a horrifying fact.
And in past decades,  we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets,  and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope,  and we sort them,  and then we put this data onto a map.
But that takes forever, it's very expensive,  and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
So with my students, ages six to 15,  we've been dreaming of inventing a better way.
So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
And so we started building this small workbench,  with different heights, so even really short kids can participate.
And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
Not really.
And so, back to plastic.
We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean,  which is very small because it breaks down.
And so this is how we work.
I let the imaginations of my students run wild.
And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea  and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits,  we are going to collect only the data.
So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot --  so robots, kids get very excited.
And the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping."
We are so rapid at prototyping  that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures  and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water  and through the plastic that we have there --  and this is the image that we get in the robot.
So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor,  and the computer on board will process this image,  and measure the size of each particle,  so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
So we documented this invention step by step  on a website for inventors called Instructables,  in the hope that somebody would make it even better.
What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem,  and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it.
[I can investigate my local problem]  But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids.
And they watch the news, they watch the Internet,  and they came across this image.
This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,  in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
So they were very shocked,  because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in,  this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live.
And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown,  so when everything is mixed up,  it's really hard to see what's in the water.
But, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spectrometry,  that allows you see what's in the water.
So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer,  and you can shine light through different substances  that produce different spectrums,  so that can help you identify what's in the water.
So we packed this prototype of a sensor,  and we shipped it to Bangladesh.
So what was cool about this project  was that beyond addressing a local problem,  or looking at a local problem,  my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative  to help, remotely, other kids.
[I can investigate a remote problem]  So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments,  and I wanted to take it even further --  maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
So I'm half Japanese and half French,  and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves --  they are called tsunami --  and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in an instant.
Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima,  the nuclear power plant just by the water.
And today, I read the reports  and an average of 300 tons  are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity  has been washed away from the Japanese coast,  and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident,  and I measure independently and with other scientists,  on land, in the river --  and this time we wanted to take the kids.
So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
But every night we would report to "Mission Control" --  different masks they're wearing.
It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did  because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life.
And so what we did with them  is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day,  and talk about where we should be going next --  strategy, itinerary, etc...
And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map  of the region around the nuclear power plant.
And so we built the elevation map,  we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity,  and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall.
And with this we could see that the radioactive dust  was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system,  and leaking into the ocean.
So it was a rough estimate.
But with this in mind, we organized this expedition,  which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant.
We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant,  and with the help of the local fisherman,  we are collecting sediment from the seabed  with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built.
You can see a progression here --  we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales,  with also very simple, open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating  because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
And so I wonder if we should just take a leap  and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small,  so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong,  and we turned it into the largest mega-space  focused on social and environmental impact.
It's in central Hong Kong,  and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry,  a bit of biology, a bit of optics,  basically you can build pretty much everything there.
And its a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kids' dreams can come true,  with the help of adults,  and where adults can be kids again.
Student: Acceleration! Acceleration!
Cesar Harada: We're asking questions such as,  can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population  by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?
So plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies,  but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.
We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth  because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers --  we must prepare the next generation  that cares about the environment and people,  and that can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes,  two radically opposed design cultures.
One is made of thousands of steel parts,  the other of a single silk thread.
One is synthetic, the other organic.
One is imposed on the environment,  the other creates it.
One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble,  he saw a figure struggling to be free.
The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.
But living things are not chiseled.
They grow.
And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information  that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate.
Tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated  by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production.
Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts,  framing the imagination of designers and architects  who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies  of discrete parts with distinct functions.
But you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature.
Take human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with large pores.
Our back skins are thicker, with small pores.
One acts mainly as filter,  the other mainly as barrier,  and yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assemblies.
It's a system that gradually varies its functionality  by varying elasticity.
So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view,  the split personality of every designer and architect operating today  between the chisel and the gene,  between machine and organism, between assembly and growth,  between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two worldviews, my left brain and right brain,  analysis and synthesis, will play out on the two screens behind me.
My work, at its simplest level,  is about uniting these two worldviews,  moving away from assembly  and closer into growth.
You're probably asking yourselves:  Why now?
Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special time in history,  a rare time,  a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools  we've never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields,  my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and hands  of my students.
We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales,  from the large-scale,  like this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach  with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings,  to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms  that glow in the dark.
Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,  an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture,  and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized  to shape the form of light and heat moving through it.
In our next project,  we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt --  this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen --  like a second skin that are made of a single part,  stiff at the contours, flexible around the waist.
Together with my long-term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys,  we 3D-printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells,  and I'll show more objects like it.
This helmet combines stiff and soft materials  in 20-micron resolution.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.
That designers have access  to such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools,  enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies,  but also the physiological makeup of our tissues.
Next, we designed an acoustic chair,  a chair that would be at once structural, comfortable  and would also absorb sound.
Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I turned to nature for inspiration,  and by designing this irregular surface pattern,  it becomes sound-absorbent.
We printed its surface out of 44 different properties,  varying in rigidity, opacity and color,  corresponding to pressure points on the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality  not by adding another material or another assembly,  but by continuously and delicately varying material property.
But is nature ideal?
Are there no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home,  but when I was young,  my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible,  and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about.
As she recounts:  "On the third day of Creation, God commands the Earth  to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."
For this first fruit tree, there was to be no differentiation  between trunk, branches, leaves and fruit.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself,  "What would design be like if objects were made of a single part?
Would we return to a better state of creation?"
So we looked for that biblical material,  that fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material, and we found it.
The second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin,  and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year  by organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
We thought if we could tune its properties,  we could generate structures that are multifunctional  out of a single part.
So that's what we did.
We called Legal Seafood --    we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,  we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste.
By varying chemical concentrations,  we were able to achieve a wide array of properties --  from dark, stiff and opaque,  to light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the structures in large scale,  we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles.
The robot would vary material properties on the fly  and create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material,  100 percent recyclable.
When the parts are ready, they're left to dry  and find a form naturally upon contact with air.
So why are we still designing with plastics?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process  were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms  that first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago,  as we learned yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT,  we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered  to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere  and convert it into sugar.
For the first time,  we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition  from beam to mesh,  and if scaled even larger, to windows.
A fruit-bearing fruit tree.
Working with an ancient material,  one of the first lifeforms on the planet,  plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology,  we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells  into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part:  for objects designed to biodegrade,  put them in the sea, and they will nourish marine life;  place them in soil, and they will help grow a tree.
The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles  was the solar system.
We looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing  for interplanetary voyages.
To do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow.
So like the periodic table, we came up with our own table of the elements:  new lifeforms that were computationally grown,  additively manufactured  and biologically augmented.
I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy,  only instead of transmuting precious metals,  you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels.
It's called microfluidics.
We 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow  of these liquid bacterial cultures.
In our first piece of clothing, we combined two microorganisms.
The first is cyanobacteria.
It lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds.
And the second, E. coli, the bacterium that inhabits the human gut.
One converts light into sugar, the other consumes that sugar  and produces biofuels useful for the built environment.
Now, these two microorganisms never interact in nature.
In fact, they never met each other.
They've been here, engineered for the first time,  to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution not by natural selection,  but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships,  we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract,  that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way.
We then started growing these channels on the human body,  varying material properties according to the desired functionality.
Where we wanted more photosynthesis, we would design more transparent channels.
This wearable digestive system, when it's stretched end to end,  spans 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field,  and 10 times as long as our small intestines.
And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED --  our first photosynthetic wearable,  liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned creatures, but only half made up."
What if design could provide that other half?
What if we could create structures that would augment living matter?
What if we could create personal microbiomes  that would scan our skins, repair damaged tissue  and sustain our bodies?
Think of this as a form of edited biology.
I call this material ecology.
To do this, we always need to return back to nature.
By now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't.
It grows. It adds with sophistication.
This silkworm cocoon, for example,  creates a highly sophisticated architecture,  a home inside which to metamorphisize.
No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication.
It does so by combining not two materials,  but two proteins in different concentrations.
One acts as the structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix,  holding those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment --  it creates a tensile structure --  and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon.
Tension and compression, the two forces of life,  manifested in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process works,  we glued a tiny earth magnet  to the head of a silkworm, to the spinneret.
We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors,  and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud  and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon.
However, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch,  not inside a box,  we realized it would spin a flat cocoon  and it would still healthily metamorphisize.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolds,  and we discovered that the shape, the composition,  the structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.
Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons,  their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry.
We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk  without boiling a single cocoon.
They would healthily metamorphisize,  and we would be able to create these things.
So we scaled this process up to architectural scale.
We had a robot spin the template out of silk,  and we placed it on our site.
We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas,  so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution  of light and heat on our structure.
We then created holes, or apertures,  that would lock in the rays of light and heat,  distributing those silkworms on the structure.
We were ready to receive the caterpillars.
We ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm.
And after four weeks of feeding, they were ready to spin with us.
We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold,  and as they spin they pupate, they mate, they lay eggs,  and life begins all over again -- just like us but much, much shorter.
Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity,  and he was right.
As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk,  they give this entire pavilion its integrity.
And over two to three weeks,  6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the Silk Road.
The moths, after they hatch, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional pavilions for the future.
So here they are, the two worldviews.
One spins silk out of a robotic arm,  the other fills in the gaps.
If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products  and the buildings around us,  to form a two-material ecology,  then designers must unite these two worldviews.
Which brings us back, of course, to the beginning.
Here's to a new age of design, a new age of creation,  that takes us from a nature-inspired design  to a design-inspired nature,  and that demands of us for the first time  that we mother nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever been asked the question  "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
Now if you had to guess,  how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question?
You can just hold up fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.
Now, raise your hand if the question  "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
has ever caused you any anxiety.
Any anxiety at all.
I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question  "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests --  it's that I had too many.
In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites  and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator.
Maybe you've heard of us.
And usually I would try and persist anyway,  because I had already devoted so much time and energy  and sometimes money into this field.
But eventually this sense of boredom,  this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore --  it would get to be too much.
And I would have to let it go.
But then I would become interested in something else,  something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that,  and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"  and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored.
And eventually, I would let it go.
But then I would discover something new and totally different,  and I would dive into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,  for two reasons.
The first was that I wasn't sure  how I was going to turn any of this into a career.
I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing,  deny all of my other passions,  and just resign myself to being bored.
The other reason it caused me so much anxiety  was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this,  and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything.
I worried that I was afraid of commitment,  or that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging,  afraid of my own success.
If you can relate to my story and to these feelings,  I'd like you to ask yourself a question  that I wish I had asked myself back then.
Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal  to doing many things.
I'll tell you where you learned it:  you learned it from the culture.
We are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
when we're about five years old.
And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age.
It's considered an innocuous question,  posed to little kids to elicit cute replies,  like, "I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina,"  or "I want to be a pirate."
Insert Halloween costume here.
But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older  in various forms -- for instance, high school students might get asked  what major they're going to pick in college.
And at some point,  "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
goes from being the cute exercise it once was  to the thing that keeps us up at night.
Why?
See, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be,  it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be.
In fact, it does just the opposite,  because when someone asks you what you want to be,  you can't reply with 20 different things,  though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like,  "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist.
You have to choose."
This is Dr. Bob Childs --    and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.
And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator, entrepreneur,  teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All they hear  is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of the narrowly focused life  is highly romanticized in our culture.
It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling,  the idea that we each have one great thing  we are meant to do during our time on this earth,  and you need to figure out what that thing is  and devote your life to it.
But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way?
What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about,  and many different things you want to do?
Well, there is no room for someone like you in this framework.
And so you might feel alone.
You might feel like you don't have a purpose.
And you might feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
What you are is a multipotentialite.
A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.
It's a mouthful to say.
It might help if you break it up into three parts:  multi, potential, and ite.
You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea,  such as polymath, the Renaissance person.
Actually, during the Renaissance period,  it was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."
Use whichever term you like, or invent your own.
I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community,  we cannot agree on a single identity.
It's easy to see your multipotentiality  as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome.
But what I've learned through speaking with people  and writing about these ideas on my website,  is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way.
Here are three  multipotentialite super powers.
One: idea synthesis.
That is, combining two or more fields  and creating something new at the intersection.
Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests  in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design,  when they founded Meshu.
Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry.
Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea  not despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at the intersections.
That's where the new ideas come from.
And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds,  are able to access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second multipotentialite superpower  is rapid learning.
When multipotentialites become interested in something,  we go hard.
We observe everything we can get our hands on.
We're also used to being beginners,  because we've been beginners so many times in the past,  and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things  and stepping out of our comfort zones.
What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines,  and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue,  so we're rarely starting from scratch.
Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer.
As a child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability  to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.
Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner.
She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales  when she was starting her practice,  and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors.
It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to,  even if you end up quitting.
You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely,  in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
The third multipotentialite superpower  is adaptability;  that is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be  in a given situation.
Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer,  sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher,  and sometimes, apparently, James Bond.
He's valuable because he does good work.
He's even more valuable because he can take on various roles,  depending on his clients' needs.
Fast Company magazine identified adaptability  as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive  in the 21st century.
The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably  that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot  in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive.
Idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability:  three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at,  and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus.
As a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites  to be themselves.
We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now,  and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.
Now, let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist.
You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.
Don't worry -- there's nothing wrong with you, either.
In fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist  and multipotentialite paired together.
The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas,  while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful partnership.
But we should all be designing lives and careers  that are aligned with how we're wired.
And sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged  simply to be more like their specialist peers.
So with that said,  if there is one thing you take away from this talk,  I hope that it is this:  embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be.
If you're a specialist at heart,  then by all means, specialize.
That is where you'll do your best work.
But to the multipotentialites in the room,  including those of you who may have just realized  in the last 12 minutes that you are one --    to you I say:  embrace your many passions.
Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes.
Explore your intersections.
Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life.
And perhaps more importantly --  multipotentialites, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In the year 1901,  a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
Auguste was delusional  and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.
Her doctor was called Alois.
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,  but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906.
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy  and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain --  the likes of which he'd never seen before.
Now here's the even more striking thing.
If Auguste had instead been alive today,  we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago.
Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
And Auguste Deter  was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections,  many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV,  statins for heart disease and much more.
But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists  who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people --  which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older,  your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years  either suffering from Alzheimer's  or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's.
Already in the United States alone,  Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
It is today the most expensive disease,  and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050,  as the baby boomer generation ages.
It may surprise you that, put simply,  Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But we've done relatively little to address it.
Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide,  Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases  because we've invested less time and money into researching it.
The US government spends 10 times more every year  on cancer research than on Alzheimer's  despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more  and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause:  a lack of awareness.
Because here's what few people know but everyone should:  Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the past 114 years,  everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought that becoming senile  was a normal and inevitable part of getting old.
But we only have to look at a picture  of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient  to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities,  the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's  significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal.
Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles  in Auguste's brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about these.
Today we know they're made from protein molecules.
You can imagine a protein molecule  as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.
There are spots on the paper that are sticky.
And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.
This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other,  forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles.
That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge  trying to understand how this malfunction works.
There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex --  like defusing a bomb.
Cutting one wire might do nothing.
Cutting others might make the bomb explore.
We have to find the right step to block,  and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, we for the most part  have been cutting wires and hoping for the best.
But now we've got together a diverse group of people --  medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process  and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step  and stop the disease.
Now let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms.
So these are healthy worms,  and you can see they're moving around normally.
These worms, on the other hand,  have protein molecules sticking together inside them --  like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage,  then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan.
This is just an initial positive result, but research like this  shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure.
After 114 years of waiting,  there's finally real hope for what can be achieved  in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
This isn't about scientists like me --  it's about you.
We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease  and that if we try, we can beat it.
In the case of other diseases,  patients and their families have led the charge for more research  and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry,  scientists and regulators.
That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s.
Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day,  are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really is down to you.
Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain is at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste,  who can't create the change they need for themselves.
Help speak up for them,  and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article  in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.
"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."
And the article is about a psychological study  designed to create romantic love in the laboratory,  and my own experience trying the study myself  one night last summer.
So the procedure is fairly simple:  two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions  and then they stare into each other's eyes  without speaking for four minutes.
So here are a couple of sample questions.
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability,  what would it be?
Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
By yourself?
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
Number 30, I really like this one:  Tell your partner what you like about them;  be very honest this time,  saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier,  one detail really stuck out to me,  and that was the rumor that two of the participants  had gotten married six months later,  and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
So I was of course very skeptical  about this process of just manufacturing romantic love,  but of course I was intrigued.
And when I got the chance to try this study myself,  with someone I knew but not particularly well,  I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
But then we did, and --    And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column  a few months later.
Now, this was published in January,  and now it is August,  so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering,  are we still together?
And the reason I think you might be wondering this  is because I have been asked this question  again and again and again for the past seven months.
And this question is really what I want to talk about today.
But let's come back to it.
So the week before the article came out,  I was very nervous.
I had been working on a book about love stories  for the past few years,  so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences  with romantic love on my blog.
But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most,  and those were usually just my Facebook friends,  and I figured my article in the New York Times  would probably get a few thousand views.
And that felt like a lot of attention  on a relatively new relationship.
But as it turned out, I had no idea.
So the article was published online  on a Friday evening,  and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views,  and I was, to say the least,  underprepared for this sort of attention.
It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly  about your experiences with love,  but it is another thing to discover  that your love life has made international news --    and to realize that people across the world  are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.
And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks,  they always asked the same question first:  are you guys still together?
In fact, as I was preparing this talk,  I did a quick search of my email inbox  for the phrase "Are you still together?"
and several messages popped up immediately.
They were from students and journalists  and friendly strangers like this one.
I did radio interviews and they asked.
I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage,  "Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"
And I promptly turned bright red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper,  you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article  for Valentine's Day,  which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves,  with varying degrees of success.
So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention  was to become very protective of my own relationship.
I said no to every request for the two of us  to do a media appearance together.
I turned down TV interviews,  and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
I think I was afraid that we would become  inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love,  a position I did not at all feel qualified for.
And I get it:  people didn't just want to know if the study worked,  they wanted to know if it really worked:  that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last,  not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
My own relationship was only a few months old,  and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
If the answer was no,  would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions  any less worthwhile?
Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions  in this study here in 1997,  and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, they wanted to foster  interpersonal closeness among college students,  by using what Aron called  "sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?
But the study did work.
The participants did feel closer after doing it,  and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol  as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and members of community,  and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.
The original version of the story,  the one that I tried last summer,  that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact,  was referenced in this article,  but unfortunately it was never published.
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk  at a small liberal arts college,  and a student came up to me afterwards  and he said, kind of shyly,  "So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
He seemed a little mystified by this.
"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.
"Well..." He paused.
"I think she just wants to be friends."
"But did you become better friends?" I asked.
"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"
He nodded.
"So, then it worked," I said.
I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for  when it comes to love.
I first came across this study  when I was 29  and I was going through a really difficult breakup.
I had been in the relationship since I was 20,  which was basically my entire adult life,  and he was my first real love,  and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
So I turned to science.
I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love,  and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
I don't know if I realized this at the time --  I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing --  but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love,  I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.
I am more confident about asking for what I want.
But I can also see myself more clearly,  and I can see that what I want is sometimes more  than can reasonably be asked for.
What I want from love is a guarantee,  not just that I am loved today  and that I will be loved tomorrow,  but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee  that people were really asking about  when they wanted to know if we were still together.
So the story that the media told about the 36 questions  was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved,  and this is a very appealing story,  because falling in love feels amazing,  but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love,  we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"
and is content with a yes or no answer.
So rather than that question,  I would propose we ask some more difficult questions,  questions like:  How do you decide who deserves your love  and who does not?
How do you stay in love when things get difficult,  and how do you know when to just cut and run?
How do you live with the doubt  that inevitably creeps into every relationship,  or even harder,  how do you live with your partner's doubt?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions,  but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation  about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want it,  the short version of the story of my relationship is this:  a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study  designed to create romantic love,  and we fell in love,  and we are still together,  and I am so glad.
But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
Falling in love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.
We're in love because we each made the choice to be."
And I cringe a little when I read that now,  not because it isn't true,  but because at the time, I really hadn't considered  everything that was contained in that choice.
I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice,  and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice  without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions,  and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun  and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
But what I have done instead is turn my relationship  into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting,  is for that myth to be true.
I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article,  which is, incidentally,  the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone,  and the hope that he will choose to love me back,  and it is terrifying,  but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,  and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back.
Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wood box,  and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box  and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas,  maybe how we ate our spaghetti.
I really didn't know.
Anyway, this is kind of funny,  because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --  I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff,  and I was making a collage for my ma.
And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up,  and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid,  and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck.
Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them,  so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something.
Instead, the opposite happened:  It sort of created a magnification,  like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.
So what did I do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started putting electronics, frogs,  strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find --  because I was always finding things my whole life,  and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects,  and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space!
I can make free-floating lines,  like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene.
So I took the objects out,  and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
First, botanical -- which you can kind of get a sense of.
Then I made some weird insects and creatures.
It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.
And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff,  I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner,  and like, go to Sizzler.
It was some good shit, man.
At some point, I got up to the human form,  life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers.
This was great, except for one thing:  I was going to die.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried using glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass,  almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window,  and another window, and you had all these windows together  that made a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.
So I did this for years,  which culminated in a very large work, which I call "The Triptych."
"The Triptych" was largely inspired  by Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"  which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.
Do you guys know this painting?
Good, it's a cool painting.
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
So, "The Triptych." I'll walk you through this piece.
It weighs 24,000 pounds.
It's 18 feet long.
It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the blood fountain.
To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts.
There's a cave  where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds.
They go from the representational world,  to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding.
This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse,  and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.
The ocean is made up of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied up to a battleship.
Billy Graham is in the ocean;  the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --  there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find  if you look really hard, in the ocean.
Anyway, this is a lady creature.
She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand  and she has clouds coming out of her other hand.
Her hands are like scales,  and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
So that's one side of "The Triptych."
It's a little narrative thing.
That's her hand that she's spitting into.
And then, when you go to the other side,  she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,  and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk.
Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The Triptych."
Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
That happens, you know.
Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball,  made out of 1986 terrorist cards.
Have you guys seen those?
They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists.
Way ahead of their time.   That will bring you to my latest project.
I'm in the middle of two projects:  One's called "Psychogeographies."
It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans.
Each one is an archive of our culture,  through our ripped-up media and matter,  whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human,  and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
They're like cells -- they come together, they divide.
And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide  with a human stuck inside.
This one has a little cave in his chest.
That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning.
I'm going to go down the body for you:  There's a waterfall coming out of his chest,  covering his penis -- or not-penis, or whatever it is,  a kind of androgynous thing.
I'll take you quickly through these works,  because I can't explain them for too long.
There are the layers, you can kind of see it.
That's a body getting split in half.
This one has two heads,  and it's communicating between the two heads.
You can see the pills coming out,  going into one head from this weird statue.
There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity.
Can you see that?
Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,  like the boxes we're in.
This box we're in, the solar system is a box.
This brings you to my latest box.
It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.
Inside of this box is a physicist,  a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,  a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school,  a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world;  a garden.
We shake this box up,  and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.
And I think that's the way you change the world.
You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in.
And you come together to realize that we're all in this together,  that this delusion of difference --  this idea of countries, of borders, of religion -- doesn't work.
We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,  we're all going to die real soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you have a headache?
You swallow an aspirin.
But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is,  it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.
Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering  any medication in the body.
The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution.
And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients.
When they take their anti-HIV drugs,  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood,  and increasing the CD4 cell counts.
But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects,  but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood,  and worse, by the time they get to the sites  where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs.
These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes,  the nervous system, as well as the lungs --  where the virus is sleeping,  and will not readily get delivered in the blood  of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.
However, upon discontinuation of therapy,  the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.
Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment,  which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients.
One day, I sat and thought,  "Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites,  without the risk of drug dilution?"
As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes:  Lasers, of course.
If they can be used for dentistry,  for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,  they can be used for anything imaginable,  including transporting drugs into cells.
As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses  to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,  which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells,  in order to deliver drugs within them.
"How is that possible?" you may ask.
Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam  onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells  while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug.
The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug  in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it,  the induced hole becomes immediately repaired.
Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes  or in Petri dishes,  but the goal is to get this technology in the human body,  apply it in the human body.
"How is that possible?" you may ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device.
Using the first head, which is our laser,  we will make an incision in the site of infection.
Using the second head, which is a camera,  we meander to the site of infection.
Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,  we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection,  while the laser is again used to poke those cells open.
Well, this might not seem like much right now.
But one day, if successful, this technology can lead  to complete eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is every HIV researcher's dream --  in our case, a cure lead by lasers.
Thank you.
For the past decade,  I've been studying non-state armed groups:  armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
My goal is to better understand these violent actors  and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement  to nonviolent confrontation.
I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.
Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict,  because war has changed.
It used to be a contest between states.
No longer.
It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the 216 peace agreements  signed between 1975 and 2011,  196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.
So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them  or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.
So how do we do that?
We need to know what makes these organizations tick.
We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight,  but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.
Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.
It is all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them,  if we don't have the full picture.
And armed groups today are complex organizations.
Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,  known for its violent confrontation against Israel.
But since its creation in the early 1980s,  Hezbollah has also set up a political party,  a social-service network, and a military apparatus.
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,  known for its suicide attacks against Israel,  also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
So these groups do way more than just shoot.
They multi-task.
They set up complex communication machines --  radio stations, TV channels,  Internet websites and social media strategies.
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,  printed in English and published to recruit.
Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising --  not looting, but setting up profitable businesses;  for example, construction companies.
Now, these activities are keys.
They allow these groups to increase their strength,  increase their funds,  to better recruit and to build their brand.
Armed groups also do something else:  they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals,  they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs.
Hezbollah offers all of these services and more.
Armed groups also seek to win the population over  by offering something that the state is not providing:  safety and security.
The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan,  or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS,  can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts  to provide security.
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,  the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population.
But in general, providing social services fills a gap,  a governance gap left by the government,  and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power.
For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas  cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.
Now, this is a really complex picture,  yet in the West, when we look at armed groups,  we only think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength,  strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid.
They rise because they fill a gap left by the government,  and they emerge to be both armed and political,  engage in violent struggle and provide governance.
And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated,  the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.
Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah?
They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions,  they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe something else, something different and new?
And what about ISIS?
The lines are blurred.
We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between,  and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today,  the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.
This matters for governments, because to counter these groups,  they will have to invest more in non-military tools.
Filling that governance gap  has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding.
If we better understand armed groups,  we will better know what incentives to offer  to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence.
So in this new contest between states and non-states,  military power can win some battles,  but it will not give us peace nor stability.
To achieve these objectives,  what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap,  in filling that governance gap  that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.
Thank you.
I am failing as a woman,  I am failing as a feminist.
I have passionate opinions about gender equality,  but I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist,"  would not be fair to good feminists.
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.
Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an essay,  and then I wrote a book called "Bad Feminist,"  and then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist.
So, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself  and a willful provocation,  has become a thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was younger,  mostly in my teens and 20s,  I had strange ideas about feminists  as hairy, angry, man-hating, sex-hating women --  as if those are bad things.
These days, I look at how women are treated the world over,  and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But back then,  I worried about the tone people used  when suggesting I might be a feminist.
The feminist label was an accusation,  it was an "F" word, and not a nice one.
I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules,  who expects too much,  who thinks far too highly of myself,  by daring to believe I'm equal --  -- superior to a man.
You don't want to be that rebel woman,  until you realize that you very much are that woman,  and cannot imagine being anyone else.
As I got older, I began to accept  that I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one.
I hold certain truths to be self-evident:  Women are equal to men.
We deserve equal pay for equal work.
We have the right to move through the world as we choose,  free from harassment or violence.
We have the right to easy, affordable access to birth control,  and reproductive services.
We have the right to make choices about our bodies,  free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When we talk about the needs of women,  we have to consider the other identities we inhabit.
We are not just women.
We are people with different bodies,  gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,  class backgrounds, abilities, and so much more.
We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us,  as much as we account for what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
I hold these truths to be self-evident, but let me be clear:  I'm a mess.
I am full of contradictions.
There are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.
Even though the lyrics are degrading to women --  these lyrics offend me to my core --  the classic Yin Yang Twins song "Salt Shaker" --  it is amazing.
"Make it work with your wet t-shirt.
Bitch, you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt!"
Think about it.
Poetry, right?
I am utterly mortified by my music choices.
I firmly believe in man work,  which is anything I don't want to do, including --   --  all domestic tasks,  but also: bug killing, trash removal, lawn care and vehicle maintenance.
I want no part of any of that.
Pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things.
I watch "The Bachelor" and romantic comedies,  and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true.
Some of my transgressions are more flagrant.
If a woman wants to take her husband's name,  that is her choice, and it is not my place to judge.
If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children,  I embrace that choice, too.
The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice;  the problem is that our society is set up  to make women economically vulnerable when they choose.
Let's deal with that.
I reject the mainstream feminism  that has historically ignored or deflected the needs  of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women,  in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I am a very bad feminist.
There is also this:  As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal.
We expect them to pose perfectly.
When they disappoint us,  we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on.
Like I said, I am a mess --  consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there.
Too many women,  particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders,  are afraid to be labeled as feminists.
They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a feminist,"  for fear of what that label means,  for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations.
Take, for example, Beyonc, or as I call her, The Goddess.
She has emerged, in recent years, as a visible feminist.
At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,  she performed in front of the word "feminist" 10 feet high.
It was a glorious spectacle to see  this pop star openly embracing feminism  and letting young women and men know  that being a feminist is something to celebrate.
As the moment faded, cultural critics began endlessly debating  whether or not Beyonc was, indeed, a feminist.
They graded her feminism,  instead of simply taking a grown, accomplished woman at her word.
We demand perfection from feminists,  because we are still fighting for so much,  we want so much,  we need so damn much.
We go far beyond reasonable, constructive criticism,  to dissecting any given woman's feminism,  tearing it apart until there's nothing left.
We do not need to do that.
Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive feminism -- is a starting point.
But what happens next?
We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability,  or walking the walk, and being a little bit brave.
If I listen to degrading music,  I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply.
These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs  until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line.
Certainly, it is difficult.
Why must it be so catchy?
It's hard to make the better choice,  and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.
But -- when I justify bad choices,  I make it harder for women to achieve equality,  the equality that we all deserve, and I need to own that.
I think of my nieces, ages three and four.
They are gorgeous and headstrong, brilliant girls,  who are a whole lot of brave.
I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are.
I think of them,  and suddenly, the better choice becomes far easier to make.
We can all make better choices.
We can change the channel when a television show  treats sexual violence against women like sport,  Game of Thrones.
We can change the radio station  when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere  when movies don't treat women  as anything more than decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports  where the athletes treat their partners like punching bags.
In other ways, men -- and especially straight white men --  can say, "No, I will not publish with your magazine,  or participate in your project, or otherwise work with you,  until you include a fair number of women,  both as participants and decision makers.
I won't work with you until your publication,  or your organization, is more inclusive of all kinds of difference."
Those of us who are underrepresented  and invited to participate in such projects,  can also decline to be included  until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling,  and we are tokens no more.
Without these efforts,  without taking these stands,  our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can commit these small acts of bravery  and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power --  editors, movie and music producers,  CEOs, lawmakers --  the people who can make bigger, braver choices  to create lasting, meaningful change.
We can also boldly claim our feminism --  good, bad, or anywhere in between.
The last line of my book "Bad Feminist" says,  "I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all."
This is true for so many reasons,  but first and foremost, I say this because once upon a time,  my voice was stolen from me,  and feminism helped me to get my voice back.
There was an incident.
I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened.
Some boys broke me, when I was so young, I did not know  what boys can do to break a girl.
They treated me like I was nothing.
I began to believe I was nothing.
They stole my voice, and in the after, I did not dare to believe  that anything I might say could matter.
But -- I had writing.
And there, I wrote myself back together.
I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women  who might understand a story like mine,  and women who looked like me,  and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing.
I learned to write like them,  and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again,  and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure.
Through writing and feminism,  I also found that if I was a little bit brave,  another woman might hear me and see me and recognize  that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I hold the power to accomplish anything.
And in my other, I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman.
I am a bad feminist,  I am a good woman,  I am trying to become better in how I think,  and what I say, and what I do,  without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope that we can all do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little bit brave,  when we most need such bravery.
Just after Christmas last year,  132 kids in California got the measles  by either visiting Disneyland  or being exposed to someone who'd been there.
The virus then hopped the Canadian border,  infecting more than 100 children in Quebec.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak  is that measles, which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system,  is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
An effective vaccine against it  has been available for more than half a century,  but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak  had not been vaccinated  because their parents were afraid  of something allegedly even worse:  autism.
But wait -- wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy  about autism and vaccines  debunked, retracted,  and branded a deliberate fraud  by the British Medical Journal?
Don't most science-savvy people  know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.?
I think most of you do,  but millions of parents worldwide  continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time.
For most of the 20th century,  autism was considered an incredibly rare condition.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it  figured they would get through their entire careers  without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable  at just three or four children in 10,000.
But then, in the 1990s,  the numbers started to skyrocket.
Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks  routinely refer to autism as an epidemic,  as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland.
So what's going on?
If it isn't vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta  what's going on,  they tend to rely on phrases like "broadened diagnostic criteria"  and "better case finding"  to explain these rising numbers.
But that kind of language  doesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother  who is searching her two-year-old's face for eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened,  why were they so narrow in the first place?
Why were cases of autism so hard to find  before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened  has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science  than it does with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century,  clinicians told one story  about what autism is and how it was discovered,  but that story turned out to be wrong,  and the consequences of it  are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second, more accurate story of autism  which had been lost and forgotten  in obscure corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here  and where we need to go next.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital  In 1943, Kanner published a paper  describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds,  ignoring the people around them,  even their own parents.
They could amuse themselves for hours  by flapping their hands in front of their faces,  but they were panicked by little things  like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place  without their knowledge.
Based on the patients who were brought to his clinic,  Kanner speculated that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject,  he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome  while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa.
That's actually not surprising,  because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism  were incredibly selective.
For example, he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures  but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids  referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians  without giving them an autism diagnosis.
Kanner was a smart guy,  but a number of his theories didn't pan out.
He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis  caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.
These children, he said,  had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.
At the same time, however,  Kanner noticed that some of his young patients  had special abilities that clustered in certain areas  like music, math and memory.
One boy in his clinic  could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two.
When his mother put on one of his favorite records,  he would correctly declare, "Beethoven!"
But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities,  claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things  they'd heard their pompous parents say,  desperate to earn their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame and stigma for families,  and two generations of autistic children  were shipped off to institutions for their own good,  becoming invisible to the world at large.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s  that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare.
Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London  who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting  were "bloody stupid," as she told me.
She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people,  and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie.
Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie  without support services,  special education,  and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis.
To make the case to the National Health Service  that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families,  Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould  decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.
They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell  to try to find autistic children in the community.
What they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow,  while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids couldn't talk at all,  while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics,  dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.
In other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,  as Judith put it,  and they saw lots of them,  way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted.
At first, they were at a loss to make sense of their data.
How had no one noticed these children before?
But then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published  in German in 1944,  the year after Kanner's paper,  and then forgotten,  buried with the ashes of a terrible time  that no one wanted to remember or think about.
Kanner knew about this competing paper,  but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work.
It had never even been translated into English,  but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,  and he translated it for her.
The paper offered an alternate story of autism.
Its author was a man named Hans Asperger,  who ran a combination clinic and residential school  in Vienna in the 1930s.
Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences  were progressive even by contemporary standards.
Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music,  and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.
Instead of blaming parents for causing autism,  Asperger framed it as a lifelong, polygenetic disability  that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations  over the course of one's whole life.
Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients,  Asperger called them his little professors,  and enlisted their help in developing methods of education  that were particularly suited to them.
Crucially, Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum  that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits are common  and always have been,  seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture  like the socially awkward scientist  and the absent-minded professor.
He went so far as to say,  it seems that for success in science and art,  a dash of autism is essential.
Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare  as he had been about parents causing it.
Over the next several years,  they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association  to broaden the criteria for diagnosis  to reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectrum."
In the late '80s and early 1990s,  their changes went into effect,  swapping out Kanner's narrow model  for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.
These changes weren't happening in a vacuum.
By coincidence, as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes  to reform the criteria,  people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.
Before "Rain Man" came out in 1988,  only a tiny, ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like,  but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt  earned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,  pediatricians, psychologists,  teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.
Coincidentally, at the same time,  the first easy-to-use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced.
You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts  to get your child evaluated.
The combination of "Rain Man,"  the changes to the criteria, and the introduction of these tests  created a network effect,  a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnoses started to soar,  just as Lorna and Judith predicted, indeed hoped, that it would,  enabling autistic people and their families  to finally get the support and services they deserved.
Then Andrew Wakefield came along  to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines,  a simple, powerful,  and seductively believable story  that was as wrong as Kanner's theory  that autism was rare.
If the CDC's current estimate,  that one in 68 kids in America are on the spectrum, is correct,  autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In recent years, autistic people have come together on the Internet  to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved  by the next medical breakthrough,  coining the term "neurodiversity"  to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand neurodiversity  is to think in terms of human operating systems.
Just because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken.
By autistic standards, the normal human brain  is easily distractable,  obsessively social,  and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
To be sure, autistic people have a hard time  living in a world not built for them.
[Seventy] years later, we're still catching up to Asperger,  who believed that the "cure" for the most disabling aspects of autism  is to be found in understanding teachers,  accommodating employers,  supportive communities,  and parents who have faith in their children's potential.
An autistic [man] named Zosia Zaks once said,  "We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity."
As we sail into an uncertain future,  we need every form of human intelligence on the planet  working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
