A portrait of alienation so perfect, it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers.
The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute.

Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots.
The gags, and the script, are a mixed bag.

Despite engaging offbeat touches, Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast.

The movie is a mess from start to finish.
The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than, as was more likely, a victim of mental illness.

In the telling of a story largely untold, Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar.
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish, and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience, but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
Terminally brain dead production.
Some episodes work, some don't.
Beautifully filmed and well acted... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics.
J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie, although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear: She's a pretty woman, but she's no working girl.
Rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre, who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects.
Not only are the film's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny, they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were.
Wow. I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.
Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted, but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all.
It's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding.
Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death, but Boyd's film offers little else of consequence.

The problem is not that it's all derivative, because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes. The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material.
There's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever.
None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think.
A processed comedy chop suey.
As spent screen series go, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink.
Fails as a dystopian movie, as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451, and even as a rip-off of The Matrix.
Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in.
An erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling, either.

A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff.
The cameo-packed, M:I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise...Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything.

The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about.
So genial is the conceit, this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout, dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen. It never is, not fully.
Even in the summertime, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities.
What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity, the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom, the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time.
As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character, there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy, clean-cut Dahmer (Jeremy Renner) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge.
Plodding, peevish and gimmicky.
The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers, but if you go in knowing that, you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox.
Oozes condescension from every pore.
``Solaris'' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work.

Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions, especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it.
(H)ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang, I'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by.
Occasionally loud and offensive, but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma.
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding
By the time you reach the finale, you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing.
Journalistically dubious, inept and often lethally dull.

... Ice Age treads predictably along familiar territory, making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12.

It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff.

Stealing Harvard doesn't care about cleverness, wit or any other kind of intelligent humor.
Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense, and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly.

Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema.

Star Trek was kind of terrific once, but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy.
(N)o matter how much good will the actors generate, Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness.

Ver Wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost, leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless.

A sham construct based on theory, sleight-of-hand, and ill-wrought hypothesis.

The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland.
The film can depress you about life itself.

An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength.
To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting, to say the least, not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved.

Mild, meandering teen flick.
Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression.
Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs, its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before.
Although it tries to be much more, it's really just another Major League.

One thing is for sure: This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou.
With a tone as variable as the cinematography, Schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs, and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm.
To better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing, and I won't be sitting through this one again...that in itself is commentary enough.
Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs, but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy.

This remake of Lina Wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero.
Silly, loud and goofy.
Why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby?

Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms, or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with.

It throws quirky characters, odd situations, and off-kilter dialogue at us, all as if to say, ``Look at this! This is an interesting movie!'' But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging.
The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid.

There's the plot, and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream.
This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action.

Cheap, vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace.
And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence's over-indulgent tirade, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest. If you are willing to do this, then you so crazy!

It's a very tasteful rock and roll movie. You could put it on a coffee table anywhere.
The movie is loaded with good intentions, but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story, Minac drains his movie of all individuality.

The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory.
The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas, which never reach satisfying conclusions.

To paraphrase a line from another Dickens' novel, Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato.
The actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly, but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types.
The result, however well-intentioned, is ironically just the sort of disposable, kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's Hollywood.

(At least) Moore is a real charmer.
John Carlen's script is full of unhappy, two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling.

The notion of deleting emotion from people, even in an advanced Prozac Nation, is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus.
Stale first act, Scrooge story, blatant product placement, some very good comedic songs, strong finish, dumb fart jokes.

A film that loses sight of its own story.
Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash.
The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison.

It makes me feel weird / Thinking about all the bad things in the world / Like puppies with broken legs / And butterflies that die / And movies starring pop queens

Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children, and too preachy for adults.
It's just a little too self-satisfied.

The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne.

Hugh Grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are.

The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos, particularly where Whitaker's misfit artist is concerned.
If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.
Sets animation back 30 years, musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50.
Weirdly, Broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end, after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car.
Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper.

Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots. The movie isn't horrible, but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave.

There's nothing remotely topical or sexy here.
The Tuxedo wasn't just bad; it was, as my friend David Cross would call it, 'Hungry-Man portions of bad'.

Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish.
An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter.
Woody Allen has really found his groove these days. The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another.
The bland outweighs the nifty, and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is.
It's such a mechanical endeavor (that) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it.
The art direction is often exquisite, and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design, leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack.
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you, then the film is a pleasant enough dish.
Ultimately, in the history of the Academy, people may be wondering what all that jazz was about ``Chicago'' in 2002. Zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a

It's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism, dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long.
A fifty car pileup of cliches.
It's a stale, overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish. Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch, it's one of the worst of the entire franchise.
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story.
As an actor's showcase, Hart's War has much to recommend it, even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player. As a story of dramatic enlightenment, the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired.

Contains the humor, characterization, poignancy, and intelligence of a bad sitcom.
It doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.

Ong chooses to present Ah Na's life as a slight, weightless fairy tale, whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism.
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of ``7th Heaven.''
Just a Kiss is a just a waste.
...this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels.
Frankly, it's kind of insulting, both to men and women. And it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting.
As if Drop Dead Gorgeous wasn't enough, this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition.
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man's quest to find an old flame.
This is a remake by the numbers, linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie.
It's better than mid-range Steven Seagal, but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades.
There's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long.

Kurys never shows why, of all the period's volatile romantic lives, Sand and Musset are worth particular attention.

If you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry, this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then.
The new film of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic.'
Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to, but its energy can't compare to the wit, humor and snappy dialogue of the original. If I want music, I'll buy the soundtrack. If I want a real movie, I'll buy the Criterion DVD.
An unremarkable, modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title.

Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle.

The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama,' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged.

Like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long: it's too much syrup and not enough fizz.

A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness.

A picture as erratic as its central character.
Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for, it certainly got lost in the ``soon-to-be-forgettable'' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile. It's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic.
Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets. Some of the characters die and others don't, and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson, and, really, nobody in the viewing audience cares.

It plays like a big-budget, after-school special with a generous cast, who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness.
There's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American. And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser.
One of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends.
Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance.
The ending doesn't work ... but most of the movie works so well I'm almost recommending it, anyway -- maybe not to everybody, but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right, and then step wrong.
It's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before.
I'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about.
Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes.
So brisk is Wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe.

Unless you're a fanatic, the best advice is: 'Scooby' don't.
A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial.
For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer. If you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film, you'll need a stronger stomach than us.
Shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen, and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera.
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether, in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin.

The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads.

A fascinating but choppy documentary.
Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company.

Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap.
The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless.

Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through.
...little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen.
Never comes together as a coherent whole.
An unintentionally surreal kid's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode.
First, for a movie that tries to be smart, it's kinda dumb. And second, what's with all the shooting?
Don't even bother to rent this on video.
There is something in Full Frontal, I guess, about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them, but like most movie riddles, it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see.
This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September.
Not counting a few gross-out comedies I've been trying to forget, this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes.
Plays like one long, meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz, rather than a fully developed story.
The film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers, and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences.
A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being.
An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more.
Bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher, when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made.
Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up.
The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another, most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults.

A film that suffers because of its many excesses.
Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient.
In any case, I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995's Forget Paris. But even then, I'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes.

'CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie.
...the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank.
Instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless, why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once?
It just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on (or be entertained by).
This action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage.
MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything. That's because relatively nothing happens.
No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'German-Expressionist,' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable.
Blue Crush follows the formula, but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling.
Boyd's screenplay (co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon.

Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? A cartoon?
Ze movie starts out so funny, then she is nothing.
Did the film inform and educate me? Yes. Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia? No. And that is where Ararat went astray.
It's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit.

It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions.
Who, exactly, is fighting whom here? Ah, yes, that would be me: fighting off the urge to doze.

Contrived, awkward and filled with unintended laughs, the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster.
Starts out with tremendous promise, introducing an intriguing and alluring premise, only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter.
The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises.
The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering. Average, at best, I'm afraid.

It's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.
The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh,' which is better than most of the writing in the movie.
Worthy of the gong.

I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays.
The soul-searching deliberateness of the film, although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit, eventually becomes too heavy for the plot.
The movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth.
As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West.
Comes across as a relic from a bygone era, and its convolutions...feel silly rather than plausible.
Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured.
It's a very sincere work, but it would be better as a diary or documentary.

None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest.
As social exposé, Skins has its heart in the right place, but that's not much to hang a soap opera on.
The whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product.
There's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned, as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate, but generally, it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance.

This one is certainly well-meaning, but it's also simple-minded and contrived.
Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else.

Since Lee is a sentimentalist, the film is more worshipful than your random E! True Hollywood Story.
Wes Craven's presence is felt; not the Craven of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' or 'The Hills Have Eyes,' but the sad schlock merchant of 'Deadly Friend.'

An authentically vague, but ultimately purposeless, study in total pandemonium.
Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases.
As the sulking, moody male hustler in the title role, (Franco) has all of Dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence, but none of his sweetness and vulnerability.

Though clearly well-intentioned, this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted.

Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain. But the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure.

Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing.
``What John does is heroic, but we don't condone it,'' one of the film's stars recently said, a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia.

It's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place, minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication (and who knew they even had any?).
While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills, suspense, and gore for video games, the movie really only succeeds in the third of these.
For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed, mostly inarticulate, hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one.
To my taste, the film's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation.
What the director can't do is make either of Val Kilmer's two personas interesting or worth caring about.
In an effort, I suspect, not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted, it offends by just being wishy-washy.
It's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script, but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role.
Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment.
...nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects.
It's not that Kung Pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves, without all Oedekerk's impish augmentation.
A very long movie, dull in stretches, with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction.
Not an objectionable or dull film; it merely lacks everything except good intentions.
A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left.
Once (Kim) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors, you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard.
The words, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,' have never been more appropriate.
What's next: ``My Mother the Car?''
All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that, really, we've been here, done that.
A sequel that's much too big for its britches.
So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines.
What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian.
A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled, despite many charming moments.
For all the writhing and wailing, tears, rage and opium overdoses, there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution.
A coarse and stupid gross-out.
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes.
Doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness, raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence.
There's something with potential here, but the movie decides, like Lavinia, to go the conservative route.
It's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions.
The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality, but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious.
But the power of these (subjects) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration, rather than contributing to a film's narrative.
Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment.
Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar.
Paid In Full is so stale, in fact, that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma's Scarface. That's a cheat.
Harrison's Flowers puts its heart in the right place, but its brains are in no particular place at all.
This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that, ironically, it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against.
A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity.
The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second.
Basically a static series of semi-improvised (and semi-coherent) raps between the stars.
Too restrained to be a freak show, too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral, too dull and pretentious to be engaging...The Isle defies an easy categorization.
An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk, romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director John McKay can swallow.
It's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic, the wife is patient, the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate, but short enough to make a dream seem possible.
``The Time Machine'' is a movie that has no interest in itself. It doesn't believe in itself, it has no sense of humor...it's just plain bored.
... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it.
A morose little soap opera about three vapid, insensitive people who take turns hurting each other. It's a feature-length adaptation of one of those ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?'' columns from Ladies Home Journal...
The film's essentially over by the meet-cute.
I'm sure if you're a Hartley fan, you might enjoy yourself... Me, I didn't care for it.
It's about following your dreams, no matter what your parents think. Socrates motions for hemlock.
The script isn't very good; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman (the actor) can make it work.
Walter Hill's pulpy, stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity.
It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal.
It's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong.
Although there are several truly jolting scares, there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at.
I'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.
Star Trek: Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before. Wince-inducing dialogue, thrift-shop costumes, prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty.
Like all abstract art, the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way, and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all.
I don't mind having my heartstrings pulled, but don't treat me like a fool.
...although this idea is ``new'' the results are tired.
I'm guessing the director is a magician. After all, he took three minutes of dialogue, 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long.
An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series, accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags, pranks, pratfalls, dares, injuries, etc.
Its well of thorn and vinegar (and simple humanity) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks.
For all its impressive craftsmanship, and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos, Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam.
Don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk.
Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through.
The documentary does little, apart from raising the topic, to further stoke the conversation.
Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread.
A better title, for all concerned, might be Swept Under the Rug.
This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs. There can be no other explanation. Hilariously inept and ridiculous.
Vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them.
(A) shapeless blob of desperate entertainment.
Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work.
Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is, this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done.
a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going.
Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time.
Pretension, in its own way, is a form of bravery. For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast, hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal.
With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry's boss, there isn't a redeeming moment here.
It's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense.
Movie fans, get ready to take off...the other direction.
(director) O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen, but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short.
The intent is almost exactly the same (as The Full Monty). All that's missing is the spontaneity, originality and delight.
No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise.
Even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog, and Robert De Niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy.
There's too much falseness to the second half, and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull, ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging.
It's not without its pleasures, but I'll stick with The Tune.
Miller is playing so free with emotions, and the fact that children are hostages to fortune, that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness.
Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life, the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine.
More maudlin than sharp.
This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento (a producer here), but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic.
It's slow -- very, very slow. It's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie. That's pure PR hype.
Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses, no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs.
Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief.
Visually rather stunning, but ultimately a handsome-looking bore, the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it.
Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end, along with Green's half-hearted movie career.
There seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going, or how long it's going to take to get there.
If you're a WWF fan, or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I., you'll probably like Rollerball.
I don't think I laughed out loud once. And when you're talking about a slapstick comedy, that's a pretty big problem.
It's so mediocre, despite the dynamic duo on the marquee, that we just can't get no satisfaction.
Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy, but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters, why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead?
...turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock.
The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy.
My reaction in a word: disappointment. His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images, but his latest has nothing going for it.
It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times, but is just too lame to work or be cool at others.
Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects, not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.
Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject.
Feels haphazard, as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot.
For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses, many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid, whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout.
In its own way, Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence, poetry, passion, and genius.
I've always dreamed of attending Cannes, but after seeing this film, it's not that big a deal.
The vintage is pure '87, with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message: Fatal Attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob; Unfaithful = don't if you're married to one.
A workshop mentality prevails.

A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance...
It's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters, hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes.
As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum, not even Ms. Redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality.
New Best Friend's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous.
an appalling 'Ace Ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak, former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton. If any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future, that'll be much funnier than anything in the film...
The humor is forced and heavy-handed, and occasionally simply unpleasant.
Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent; Perdition, meanwhile, reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas.
While the script starts promisingly, it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target.
As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game, I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor.
This isn't even Madonna's Swept Away. This is her Blue Lagoon.
The director knows how to apply textural gloss, but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom.
...the film suffers from a lack of humor (something needed to balance out the violence)...
Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast.
An overemphatic, would-be wacky, ultimately tedious sex farce.
Has all the depth of a wading pool.
This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another, narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse, and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing.
The so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing (featuring the voices of Glenn Close, Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer) brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks.
... the movie is just a plain old monster.
If this disposable tissue has one wild card, it's John Turturro, who's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish.
One long string of cliches.
Fancy a real downer? (Leigh) lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race.
Professionally speaking, it's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller.
Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film, leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle.
Weaves a spell over you, with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger. But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell.
At once half-baked and overheated.
There's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here, but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it.
I still can't relate to Stuart: He's a mouse, for cryin' out loud, and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough.
(Serry) wants to blend politics and drama, an admirable ambition. It's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one.
By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk,...actually pretty good. Of course, by more objective measurements it's still quite bad.
The only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them.
Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out.
Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids.
Its story may be a thousand years old, but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us?
The problem with this film is that it lacks focus. I sympathize with the plight of these families, but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand.
A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year.
... think of it as American Pie On Valium.
Dull, lifeless, and amateurishly assembled.
Puportedly ``Based on True Events,'' a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is ``Based on a True Story'' with a straight face.
...a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge...the filmmakers' paws, sad to say, were all over this ``un-bear-able'' project!
It's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel.
With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap.
Some of it is clever, but it is never melodic/
Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami. For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery.
No aspirations to social import inform the movie version. This is a shameless sham, calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars.
Manages to be somewhat well-acted, not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling, touching or, yikes, uproarious.
This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd, and that's about all it does well.
It's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go, and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination.
As vulgar as it is banal.
You wonder why Enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie.
The film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go.
The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second.
More whiny downer than corruscating commentary.
Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he's understated and sardonic, she's appealingly manic and energetic. Both deserve better.

Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit.
A wildly inconsistent emotional experience.
Sit through this one, and you won't need a magic watch to stop time; your DVD player will do it for you.
A sometimes tedious film.
Teen movies have really hit the skids.
There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through.
...plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller.
Nasty, ugly, pointless and depressing, even if you hate clowns.
What is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy, an inkling of genuine wit, and anything resembling acting.
does paint some memorable images ..., but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color.
just not campy enough
The movie, directed by Mick Jackson, leaves no cliche unturned, from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting.
It's everything you don't go to the movies for.
Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up: everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter.
The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects.
For all its technical virtuosity, the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking.

The action switches between past and present, but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide.
Nonsensical, dull ``cyber-horror'' flick is a grim, hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting.
Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone.
Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane.
A great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar.
There ought to be a directing license, so that Ed Burns can have his revoked.
The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned.
Whereas last year's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie, this equally brutal outing merely sustains it.
... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause.

A lackluster, unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan.

This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode, but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again.
While there's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying 'Get in the car, bitch,' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
It's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth.
Let's hope -- shall we? -- that the 'true story' by which All the Queen's Men is allegedly ``inspired'' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen.
Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film? I don't think so. Nothing wrong with performances here, but the whiney characters bugged me.
There is very little dread or apprehension, and though I like the creepy ideas, they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill.

A fitfully amusing romp that, if nothing else, will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star, Frankie Muniz.

At the very least, if you don't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater, you won't know much more when you leave.
The actors are appealing, but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental.
As 'chick flicks' go, this one is pretty miserable, resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting.

Serving Sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs.

Deadeningly dull, mired in convoluted melodrama, nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness.
A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip, young adult entertainment.
Like the Chelsea's denizens ... Burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste.

The film makes a fatal mistake: It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life.
Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues.
Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls, stubbly chins, liver spots, red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere.
I can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but I almost can; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it.
Complete lack of originality, cleverness or even visible effort
Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed, haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining.

The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts.
Although Huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it, The Piano Teacher is anything but fun.
It showcases Carvey's talent for voices, but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff.
Bad. Very bad. Stultifyingly, dumbfoundingly, mind-numbingly bad.
May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen.
If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride, don't settle for this Imposter.

The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy, something from a Halloween that died.
Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is.
The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold, bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves.

Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit. But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material.
Long Time Dead? Not nearly long enough.
Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle.
A solid film...but more conscientious than it is truly stirring.
There's not enough here to justify the almost two hours.
The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes, which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays.

Trite, banal, cliched, mostly inoffensive.

It's not original, and, robbed of the element of surprise, it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks.
Whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite, Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife/colleague, Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy.
It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment.
A sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes.
Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay.
I'm just too bored to care.
Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films, but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater.
Not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid.
As befits its title, this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear.

I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier, by Rohmer, for example.
Prurient playthings aside, there's little to love about this English trifle.
This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.
The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark, decadent truffle.
It's played in the most straight-faced fashion, with little humor to lighten things up. The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence.
Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag.' At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch.
A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard, particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers.
The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip. The end result is a film that's neither.
Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable. Something like scrubbing the toilet. Or emptying rat traps. Or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife.
Scooby Dooby Doo / And Shaggy too / You both look and sound great. / But Daphne, you're too Buff / Fred thinks he's tough / And Velma - wow, you've lost weight!

Some of their jokes work, but most fail miserably and in the end, Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny.
Even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with Trouble Every Day; the movie lacks both thrills and humor.
comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special, freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class. ...Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears, ``Crossroads'' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns.
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
It's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating, involving character study, but never does more than scratch the surface.
The title not only describes its main characters, but the lazy people behind the camera as well.
Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s, and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn.
Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies, and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character.
Demands too much of most viewers.
The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured (and torturing) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on.
It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit. So I just did.
Shamelessly sappy and, worse, runs away from its own provocative theme.
The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear.
The film seems a dead weight. The lack of pace kills it, although, in a movie about cancer, this might be apt.
For anyone who grew up on Disney's 1950 Treasure Island, or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic, this one feels like an impostor.
A clutchy, indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against... well, just stuff. Watching Scarlet Diva, one is poised for titillation, raw insight or both. Instead, we just get messy anger, a movie as personal therapy.
Meandering, sub-aquatic mess: It's so bad it's good, but only if you slide in on a freebie.
The ending is a cop-out. What happens to John Q? I don't have an I Am Sam clue.

... Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves.
Unlike his directorial efforts, La Femme Nikita and The Professional, The Transporter lacks Besson's perspective as a storyteller.
The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than, say, ten... make that three minutes.
Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak, as are most of the subplots. This one's weaker than most.
Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones.

To say Analyze That is De Niro's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career.
The actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them, forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes.
An often-deadly boring, strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane, inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions.
Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
Another week, another gross-out college comedy--ugh.
Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance.
There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain, today's version of Greek tragedy, the talk-show guest decrying her fate.

Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films: Young is cool, and too young is too cool.
I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around, but maybe it'll be on video by then.
Uncertain in tone... a garbled exercise in sexual politics, a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things.
All's well that ends well, and rest assured, the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags.
The only thing worse than your substandard, run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound.
If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck, wait till you see Maid in Manhattan.
Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd.
It's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull, nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish.
Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character.
In the end, Ted Bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac; there's no larger point, and little social context.
... (like)channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie.
A movie that, rather than skip along the Seine, more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris, tongue uncomfortably in cheek.

The worst kind of independent; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
It may be a prize winner, but Teacher is a bomb.
The production values are up there. The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick. The voices are fine as well. The problem, it is with most of these things, is the script.

Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie.
Well, it does go on forever.

Topkapi this is not.
If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith, why didn't he just do it, instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing?
Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it's all over his Chelsea Walls.
Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama.
I'm not suggesting that you actually see it, unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s.
While the film misfires at every level, the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy.
If you liked the 1982 film then, you'll still like it now.

This is a throwaway, junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself.
...with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum, I realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time. It's a trifle.
Literally nothing in The Pool is new, but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes.
Arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie.
Anyway, for one reason or another, Crush turns into a dire drama partway through. After that, it just gets stupid and maudlin. Too bad, but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances, it's not a total loss.
Chao was Chen Kaige's assistant for years in China. He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about.
A mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world.
The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously.

So what is the point? Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland, basically.
This is junk food cinema at its greasiest.
When it's all wet, Blue Crush is highly enjoyable. When it's on dry land, though, this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper.

The charms of willful eccentricity, at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay, are beginning to wear a bit thin.

A compendium of Solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes.
If the title is a Jeopardy question, then the answer might be ``How does Steven Seagal come across these days?'' or maybe ``How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering?''

Ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted, from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke.

Little more than a frothy vanity project.
The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending.
Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action, tedium for thrills.

The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller.
The appeal of the vulgar, sexist, racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet.
The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real--she can't provide any conflict.
IHOPs don't pile on this much syrup.
For the most part, I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies.

It's often faintly amusing, but the problems of the characters never become important to us, and the story never takes hold.
It's tough, astringent, darkly funny and... well, it's also generic, untidy, condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning.
Largely a for-fans artifact.
There's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions, nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan, but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense, lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity.
Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better.

Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship.
Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations.

The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized.

It's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--I'm prepared to call it a draw.
Even as lame horror flicks go, this is lame.

A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality.

The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously, but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students.
A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick.
A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through.
The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark.
Plays as hollow catharsis, with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights.
It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary. But here's the real damn: It isn't funny, either.
Quick: who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security?
The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film, which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say, is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory.
What you get with Empire is a movie you've seen many times before, repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead.
Cho's fans are sure to be entertained; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I'm not one of them.
Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination.
The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1, but falls apart long before the end.
High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character.
The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy, but there's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can, given the embarrassing script and weak direction.
De Niro looks bored, Murphy recycles Murphy, and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal.
I didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot.
Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate.
With Danilo Donati's witty designs and Dante Spinotti's luscious cinematography, this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only Benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role.
So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun.
Though it draws several decent laughs, it's low-cal Woody at best.
Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags.
Britney's performance cannot be faulted. Lucy's a dull girl, that's all.

Sadly, Hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns, not making snappy comebacks.
If Melville is creatively a great whale, this film is canned tuna.
This film is so slick, superficial and trend-hoppy, that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay.
Just one more collection of penis, breast and flatulence gags in search of a story. Or a profit. Or some damn thing.
The acting is stiff, the story lacks all trace of wit, the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year.
Enough trivializes an important crisis, reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment.
The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and, instead, rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep. I like Frank the Pug, though.
A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian, though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up, this has to be among the rare ones.
Gee, a second assassin shot Kennedy? Moot point.
A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face.
Needless to say, the dramatics that follow are utter hooey.
The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise, Mr. Desplechin is content to state it.
Madonna still can't act a lick.
Even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer's screenplay, which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien, with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship.
If you pitch your expectations at an all time low, you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce.
The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life. But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored.
Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and, perhaps unwittingly, relating it to what is happening in America in 2002. But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour.
Don't let your festive spirit go this far.
Though the book runs only about 300 pages, it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear.
Hey, at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading.
Intended to be a comedy about relationships, this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area.
Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary.
Director Brian Levant, who never strays far from his sitcom roots, skates blithely from one implausible situation to another, pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a French poodle.
...perhaps the heaviest, most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world.
Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle, but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal.
I'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes.
Movies like this are selling the old European candor, the old wink of 'bold' revelation. But in 2002, such revelations wilt.
The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off.
I admire it and yet cannot recommend it, because it overstays its natural running time.
A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy.
Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind.
Even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before, it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi's easy-going likableness.
The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence.
Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy.
McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
A recipe for cinematic disaster...part Quentin Tarantino, part Guy Ritchie, and part 1960s spy spoof, it's all bad.
The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama.
Another big, dumb action movie in the vein of XXX, The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through.
Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend. When she speaks, her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music.
Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time. We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride.
Much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing (the movie's) mindset.
Well before it's over, Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels.
Home Alone goes Hollywood, a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do. Besides, real movie producers aren't this nice.
(Nelson's) movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised, unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes.
Passion, lip-synching, tragedy, and lots of really really high notes. For me, this opera isn't a favorite, so it's a long time before the fat lady sings.

Truth to tell, if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films, there's nothing here you haven't seen before.

Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge.
Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low. Fortunately for all involved, this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water.
The movie gets muted and routine.
The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
It's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over, but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest.
The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels.
It's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high.
I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness.
K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic, but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich.
A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale...a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more.

The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off.
Feels less like it's about teenagers, than it was written by teenagers.
Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap. It would have benefitted the dialogue.
A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas.
Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks, Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb, all wrapped up into one.
It's badly acted, blandly directed, and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school.
In the end, White Oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel. It's a flashy, star-splashed reduction.
This film, starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock, is your typical 'fish out of water' story. You've seen them a million times. Just one problem: Fish out of water usually die. This one does.
The angst-ridden, affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging.
A soggy, shapeless mess...just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie.
Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce. An ungainly, comedy-deficient, B-movie rush job...
A combination of standard, stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move.
An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare, where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living.
Say this for the soundtrack, it drowns out the lousy dialogue.
After seeing SWEPT AWAY, I feel sorry for Madonna.
Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing, Hart's War, like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl, waits until after halftime to get started.
A gob of drivel so sickly sweet, even the eager consumers of Moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée.
Maudlin and melodramatic we expected. Boring we didn't.
Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline doesn't live up to Barry's dead-eyed, perfectly chilled delivery.
The film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place.
It almost plays like Solaris, but with guns and jokes.
A baffling misfire, and possibly the weakest movie (Woody Allen) has made in the last twenty years.
It won't be long before you'll spy I Spy at a video store near you.
This film looks like it was produced in 1954, shelved for 48 years, and repackaged for a 2002 audience.
Propelled not by characters but by caricatures.
There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production.
This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes, but feels twice as long.
Earnest but earthbound...a slow, soggy, soporific, visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast.
The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky.
For all its alleged youthful fire, XXX is no less subservient to Bond's tired formula of guns, girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero.
A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie.
If I Spy were funny (enough) or exciting (enough) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public.
Frustratingly, Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music.
Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting, and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller.
Stephen Earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental, straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type.
A very average science fiction film.
Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay, the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters.
How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us.
The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap.
The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself, which contains few laughs and not much drama.
The plot is straight off the shelf, the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy.
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness.
Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida. Or, you can do something fun tonight.
Jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips.
As with too many studio pics, plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure.
Static, repetitive, muddy and blurry, Hey Arnold! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year.
For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers, the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear.
When it comes to entertainment, children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever.
What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about.
While Benigni (who stars and co-wrote) seems to be having a wonderful time, he might be alone in that.
Yes, 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes, but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away?
Preposterous and tedious, Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that, unfortunately, occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure.
Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment: it's more like entertainment for trolls.
None of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life, unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter.
... just a big mess of a movie, full of images and events, but no tension or surprise.
As elegantly crafted as it often is, Anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that, hampered by an undeveloped script, ultimately pulls up lame.

... has virtually no script at all ...
Will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good, the bad and the ugly.
This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate, surgical touch. But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick (remember Cabin Boy?) just pound away.
At times, however, Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow, or care about.
Rather quickly, the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation.
Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster.
The writers, director Wally Wolodarsky, and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity: Kappa Rho Alpha Phi.
Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description.
The new faces are interesting, but the old story isn't, especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted.
Most of the action setups are incoherent.

... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs.
The problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball.
Dreary, highly annoying...'Some Body' will appeal to No One.
There's something deeply creepy about Never Again, a new arrow in Schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes.
The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one, there's no saving the movie. Sorry, Charlie
A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots.

All ends well, sort of, but the frenzied comic moments never click.
If this is the Danish idea of a good time, prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war, perhaps.
Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor.
Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives, still with the boiler suit and white mask, which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry.
When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters, you know you're in trouble.
(Two) fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada, and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now.

The central story lacks punch.

A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy.
What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical.
The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion.

This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes, but it's a tad slow.
While Super Troopers is above Academy standards, its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling.
A mix of velocity and idiocy, this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original.
The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year's murkiest, intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures, and Solaris is its big-budget brother.
The plot is very clever, but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events, all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of.
The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture

A well acted and well intentioned snoozer.
The smug, oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive.

Kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing, while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action.
While obviously an extremely personal work, it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut.

fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense.
A gorgeous, somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising.
A semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it.
It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play: Even at its best, it will never hold a candle to the original.
The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other.
The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it.

A graceless, witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller.

National Lampoon's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
This is a great subject for a movie, but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity, using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on.
Ecks this one off your must-see list.
Overall, the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek's novel by some way. It settles for being merely grim.
The Irwins emerge unscathed, but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted.
It's not thirsty, consuming passion which drives this movie. No, it's the repetition of said behavior, and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad, more grating and boring than anything else.

Just like the deli sandwich: lots of ham, lots of cheese, with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after (or during) consumption of its second half.

Not a cheap slasher flick, as the subject matter would suggest, but is a little like a nature film, showing a patient predator and his foolish prey.
Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres.
Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable, but the notion that a strong, unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola's inadequate performance.
All in all, there's only one thing to root for: expulsion for everyone.
Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just isn't much to laugh at.
Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny.
The film's center will not hold.
Myers never knows when to let a gag die; thus, we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another.
Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise.
A great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie, and Crazy as Hell doesn't even have a great ending.

The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom, but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing.
The movie is as far as you can get from racy, to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain; it has a dull, costumey feel.
Once the audience figure out what's being said, the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care.
There's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought.
It seems just a long, convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag, no less.
The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in, but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover.

The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes.
Just a bloody mess.

A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401(k) statement.
The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit.
Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters. And forget about any attempt at a plot!
It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans, but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow, peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture.
Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo's cool jackets.
It's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time.

A sudsy cautionary tale.
A movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess.
Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well. Their film falters, however, in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy, a salute that I'd hoped the movie would avoid.

Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns, creating a meandering, inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film.
The movie makes absolutely no sense. Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question: Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb?
The problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot. Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent, we all could have stopped watching long ago.

What's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete, if irritating, notion of class.
The stories here suffer from the chosen format.

The Master Of Disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy.
The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly... Alas, Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman (who never gets to play that flute) has all the charm of a meltdown.
The stupidest, most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter.
It's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters, including Ana's father and grandfather, come down on the issue of Ana's future.
A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not.

Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners, a fact which, as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs, seems inconceivable.

...pitiful, slapdash disaster. A DOA dud from frame one.
Jaw-droppingly superficial, straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter's glory days on Three's Company.

Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film.

No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place. Where their heads were is anyone's guess.
Call me a cynic, but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message.
A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional, unlikable characters and hackneyed, threadbare comic setups.

A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow's car.
Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions.
I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood, nothing good can happen.
Gaghan captures the half-lit, sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms, a subtlety that makes the silly, over-the-top coda especially disappointing.
Feels less like a change in (Herzog's) personal policy than a half-hearted fluke.
One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced.
Will anyone who isn't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video?
A selection of scenes in search of a movie.
(Janey) forgets about her other obligations, leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes, maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies.
Will undoubtedly play well in European markets, where Mr. Besson is a brand name, and in Asia, where Ms. Shu is an institution, but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic.
True to its animatronic roots:...as stiff, ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus...'The Country Bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation.
(Evans is) a fascinating character, and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie.

Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story, but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention.
A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches.

The redeeming feature of Chan's films has always been the action, but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and, what's worse, routine.

Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool.
A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel.
A Lifetime movie about men.
The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman.
It's hard to say who might enjoy this, are there Tolstoy groupies out there? It's dark and tragic, and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
This is a movie that starts out like Heathers, then becomes Bring it On, then becomes unwatchable.
The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines.
I think it was Plato who said, 'I think, therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one.'
If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight, next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about.
This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad's wallet.
Contrived, maudlin and cliche-ridden...if this sappy script was the best the contest received, those rejected must have been astronomically bad.
I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art.
This is more a case of 'Sacre bleu!' than 'Magnifique'.
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored, cheering the pratfalls but little else; their parents, wise folks that they are, read books.

Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon.
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material, but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort.
Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime.
Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke, you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made.
This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering. Instead, it'll only put you to sleep.
Who is this movie for? Not kids, who don't need the lesson in repugnance. It's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy.'

Ponderous, plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film.
Cold, pretentious, thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy.

Human Nature is a goofball movie, in the way that Malkovich was, but it tries too hard.
Originality is sorely lacking.
The plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story. But while the highly predictable narrative falls short, Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold.
Though there are entertaining and audacious moments, the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation.
Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians, of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour.

This story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour.
This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People.

A big, loud, bang-the-drum bore.
(Less a movie than) an appalling, odoriferous thing... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment.
The concept behind Kung Pow: Enter the Fist is hilarious. It's too bad nothing else is.

(A) painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
Even if you're an Elvis person, you won't find anything to get excited about on this DVD.
The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue, but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface.
It's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction.
I'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment.
The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life.

It drowns in sap.
Deliberately and devotedly constructed, Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect, too neat and new pin-like, too obviously a recreation to resonate.
It's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious.

The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense.
With its paint fights, motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment, it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés.
Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic: two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values.
Kicks off with an inauspicious premise, mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper.
A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling.
The material and the production itself are little more than routine.
The movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula, though, and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had.
Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie.
It's all surface psychodramatics.

(Seagal's) strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's Razzie.
Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes.
A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander, some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story.
Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext, skims over the realities of gay sex, and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight, middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves.
A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness.
The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance.

There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church, synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door. The same should go for movie theaters.

As it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs.
This franchise has not spawned a single good film. The crap continues.

Like its script, which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through, the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull, brain-deadening hangover.

Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart; very meticulously but without any passion.
Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick.

Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns.
Halfway through the movie, the humor dwindles. It's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have (and probably should have) been a lighthearted comedy.

An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art.
The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs.
With lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- Max is static, stilted.

A glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick.
... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse, turning into a black hole of dullness, from which no interesting concept can escape.
It's just plain boring.
Sad nonsense, this. But not without cheesy fun factor.
One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time.
Really dumb but occasionally really funny.
The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy, life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial.
The director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff.
While the transgressive trappings (especially the frank sex scenes) ensure that the film is never dull, Rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought, making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative.
The satire is unfocused, while the story goes nowhere.
They threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans.
It's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of (Woo's) best work.
Reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer, but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
If you're over 25, have an IQ over 90, and have a driver's license, you should be able to find better entertainment.

...the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine.
Never does ``Lilo & Stitch'' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney's great past, or even that of more recent successes such as ``Mulan'' or ``Tarzan.''
One of those so-so films that could have been much better.
Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film, replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama.
Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics, genre thrills or inherent humor.
Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic, and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots.
Cacoyannis' vision is far less mature, interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts.
It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie, which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline.
It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept.
Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle.
It's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling, regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter.
Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed. The only problem is that, by the end, no one in the audience or the film seems to really care.
No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast, but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing. Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show.
Due to stodgy, soap opera-ish dialogue, the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer.
(T)he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation.
While it may not add up to the sum of its parts, Holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded, and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often.
An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship.
Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it, from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute, haphazard theatrical release.
A thoroughly awful movie--dumb, narratively chaotic, visually sloppy...a weird amalgam of 'The Thing' and a geriatric 'Scream.'
...another example of how Sandler is losing his touch.
Nothing sticks, really, except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad, sordid universe of guns, drugs, avarice and damaged dreams.
What goes on for the 110 minutes of ``Panic Room'' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals.
The plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained.
Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this: it's not scary in the slightest.
Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists, wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers, twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs...
Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously, but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare.
By the final whistle you're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just doesn't have big screen magic.
To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor.
A film of empty, fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun.
Pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away. It's fun, but it's a real howler.
Some fine acting, but ultimately a movie with no reason for being.
It's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie, beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting.
A waterlogged version of 'Fatal Attraction' for the teeny-bopper set...a sad, soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads.

Sweet gentle Jesus, did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history?
It's not the worst comedy of the year, but it certainly won't win any honors.
This is for the most part a useless movie, even with a great director at the helm.
A loud, witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series.
Even on its own ludicrous terms, The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum, and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series.
Though it inspires some (out-of-field) creative thought, the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract.
As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game, Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre, and a personal low for everyone involved.
Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes, masturbation jokes, and racist Japanese jokes.
Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America's knee-jerk moral sanctimony, Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval.
More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller.
The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence, complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence, but not a drop of human blood.
Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow, but scarcely nourishing.
Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market.
Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along.
It's a thin notion, repetitively stretched out to feature length, awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects, droning house music and flat, flat dialogue.
On a certain base level, Blue Crush delivers what it promises, just not well enough to recommend it.
The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh's rise up the social ladder.
... an incredibly heavy-handed, manipulative dud that feels all too familiar.
Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating, so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted.
Trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'What if?' scenario that will give most parents pause... Then, something terrible happens.
Madonna has made herself over so often now, there's apparently nothing left to work with, sort of like Michael Jackson's nose.
Never having seen the first two films in the series, I can't compare Friday After Next to them, but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days.
The story is lacking any real emotional impact, and the plot is both contrived and cliched.
A depraved, incoherent, instantly disposable piece of hackery.
It's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring.
(Soderbergh) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence, and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness.
Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism.
So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag.
Scooby-Doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly, Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick.
Russell lacks the visual panache, the comic touch, and perhaps the budget of Sommers's title-bout features.
Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within.
Very stupid and annoying.

A listless and desultory affair.
Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen.
How inept is Serving Sara? It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly.
Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes. Every five minutes or so, someone gets clocked.

Any Chekhov is better than no Chekhov, but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years.
Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy, but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome.
Lazy, miserable and smug. This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.
Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market.
Every visual joke is milked, every set-up obvious and lengthy, every punchline predictable. There's no energy.
Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film.
After the setup, the air leaks out of the movie, flattening its momentum with about an hour to go.
This is a poster movie, a mediocre tribute to films like Them!
At three hours and with very little story or character development, there is plenty of room for editing, and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother, more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue.
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.
A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss.
The film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings, especially in the last few cloying moments.
If you recognize Zeus (the dog from Snatch) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one.
This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself, 'Ah, yes, here we have a bad, bad, bad movie.'
Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story, but you might want to think twice before booking passage.
Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up.
There's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie, about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present.
It's at once laughable and compulsively watchable, in its committed dumbness.
All the sensuality, all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been, pardon the pun, sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness.
A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood, this movie strives to be more, but doesn't quite get there. Good performances keep it from being a total rehash.
The screenplay is hugely overwritten, with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children.
Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal.
At times, the movie looks genuinely pretty. Your nightmares, on the other hand, will be anything but. Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow.
Elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke. If you're looking for a tale of Brits behaving badly, watch Snatch again. It's 51 times better than this.
It's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing, let alone funny.
Despite its promising cast of characters, Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny.'
Both shrill and soporific, and because everything is repeated five or six times, it can seem tiresomely simpleminded.
Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny.
Neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored.
Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting. There are a few modest laughs, but certainly no thrills.
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur.
There's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling, which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title.

A preposterous, prurient whodunit.
Go, girls, right down the reality drain.
Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory, Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie.
Can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality.
Predictable and cloying, though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle.
...unlikable, uninteresting, unfunny, and completely, utterly inept.
The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart, mind or humor of its own.
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie.
Muddled, melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner.
Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash.
Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny.
`Matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout...but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy.
At least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director, Charles Stone III.
It all unfolds predictably, and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time, providing no real sense of suspense.
Wanker Goths are on the loose! Run for your lives!
Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects?
A grating, emaciated flick.
Unambitious writing emerges in the movie, using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook.
Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency.
We have poignancy jostling against farce, thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners, and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except, maybe, that it looks neat.
According to the script, Grant and Bullock's characters are made for each other. But you'd never guess that from the performances.
The animation merely serves up a predictable, maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King, yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies.
Ararat feels like a book report
Steve Oedekerk is, alas, no Woody Allen.
A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud, violent and mindless.
An amalgam of The Fugitive, Blade Runner, and Total Recall, only without much energy or tension.
The acting is amateurish, the cinematography is atrocious, the direction is clumsy, the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing.
Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older, and that's something I would rather live in denial about
With miscast leads, banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax, Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp.
Alas, the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick.
The slapstick is labored, and the bigger setpieces flat.
This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks.
The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it's offensive, but that it's boring.
Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged, as if filmed directly from a television monitor, while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché.
the film never rises above a conventional, two dimension tale
Mark Wahlberg...may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat, but as a character he's dry, dry, dry.
Told in scattered fashion, the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject.
The irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own.
Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on ``The Mothman Prophecies''.
If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter, this is it. If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution, this is it.
With an unusual protagonist (a kilt-wearing Jackson) and subject matter, the improbable ``Formula 51'' is somewhat entertaining, but it could have been much stronger.
Sandra Bullock's best dramatic performance to date (is) almost enough to lift (this) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser...above its paint-by-numbers plot.
A feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about.
Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick, although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service.'
This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost.
The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment.
De Niro cries. You'll cry for your money back.
Slap me, I saw this movie.
(The kid's) just too bratty for sympathy, and as the film grows to its finale, his little changes ring hollow.
Behind the glitz, Hollywood is sordid and disgusting. Quelle surprise!
Scherfig, who has had a successful career in TV, tackles more than she can handle.
Just consider what New Best Friend does not have, beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay.
Oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era. They just have problems, which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way.
Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders, Chan wades through putrid writing, direction and timing with a smile that says, 'If I stay positive, maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures, Drunken Master.'
So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film.
In the end, the movie bogs down in insignificance, saying nothing about Kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate.
Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés.
Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates.
One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids, children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation.
There's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good: stop buying tickets to these movies.
'Rare Birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience.
The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive.
Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings. In other words, about as bad a film you're likely to see all year.

The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break.
Well made but uninvolving, Bloodwork isn't a terrible movie, just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery.
So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober, filmed on the set of Carpenter's The Thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat.
The movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster.
Kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults, provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people. 'Snow Dogs' has both.
It's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film.
Wobbly Senegalese updating of ``Carmen'' which is best for the stunning star turn by Djeinaba Diop Gai
It's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long.
Ken Russell would love this. In one scene, we get a stab at soccer hooliganism, a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes.

What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess.

The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects.

The whole thing feels like a ruse, a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or, worse yet, nonexistent -- ideas.
What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is!
The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film.
Opera on film is never satisfactory. The art demands live viewing. The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen.
Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky, the film is essentially juiceless.
It is parochial, accessible to a chosen few, standoffish to everyone else, and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill

It's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay.
Terminally bland, painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie, shot on digital videotape rather than film, is frequently indecipherable.

A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt.
(T)his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film, as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen.
The movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane, carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh.
...may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence. This Scarlet's letter is A...as in aimless, arduous, and arbitrary.
Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp.
The central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest.
A modestly comic, modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that, in terms of authenticity, is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight.
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks.
Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another, making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be.
A little less extreme than in the past, with longer exposition sequences between them, and with fewer gags to break the tedium.
There's a heavy stench of 'been there, done that' hanging over the film. It's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more.
The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself. She's a cipher, played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life.
A quaint, romanticized rendering.

The movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness.
A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted.
Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending. Now he makes them.

There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew.
A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work.
Schnitzler's film has a great hook, some clever bits and well-drawn, if standard issue, characters, but is still only partly satisfying.
Even if it made its original release date last fall, it would've reeked of a been-there, done-that sameness.
Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience.
A loud, ugly, irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target.
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture. We can tell what it is supposed to be, but can't really call it a work of art.
It's a brilliant, honest performance by Nicholson, but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up. Bravado Kathy!
...Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario. Too bad.

Co-writer/director Jonathan Parker's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like, hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short.
If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards, more power to it.

If there's a heaven for bad movies, Deuces Wild is on its way.
Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard.
What's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour. Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough.
An uninspired preachy and clichéd war film.
Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible.
A movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self... this Orgasm (won't be an) exceedingly memorable one for most people.
Slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by.
If Festival in Cannes nails hard- boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy, much about the film, including some of its casting, is frustratingly unconvincing.
The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value.
I haven't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered.
Little more than a well-mounted history lesson.

When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo, it looks like Woo's a P.O.W.
There are a few chuckles, but not a single gag sequence that really scores, and the stars seem to be in two different movies.
The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones, but all it amounts to is a mildly funny, sometimes tedious, ultimately insignificant film.
It's dull, spiritless, silly and monotonous: an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem, going nowhere fast.
The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker.
Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony, formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance.
The movie turns out to be (Assayas') homage to the Gallic 'tradition of quality,' in all its fusty squareness.
Its message has merit and, in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack, might have made a point or two regarding life.

It's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread.
Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers, the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price.
If swimfan does catch on, it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh.
What might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors.

Has the marks of a septuagenarian; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick.
Like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive, fitfully amusing, but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen.
Something must have been lost in the translation.
Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film: boring.

Chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy.
Rock's stand-up magic wanes. Hopkins, squarely fills the screen. Action - mechanical.
``The Tuxedo'' should have been the vehicle for Chan that ``The Mask'' was for Jim Carrey. Alas, it's the man that makes the clothes.
For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson's Creek, they'll probably run out screaming.
The biggest problem I have (other than the very sluggish pace) is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress, even though her talent is supposed to be growing.
What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first movie.
Plot, characters, drama, emotions, ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King.

The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea.
Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie, which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy.
Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley's breasts -- is authentic.
Amid the cliché and foreshadowing, Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn.
Mostly, Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint, or a sense of humor.
No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild.
Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy, but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good.
Strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression.
There's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life, but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes.
It's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character, especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix's.

We're left with a story that tries to grab us, only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments.
Like many such biographical melodramas, it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories.

The film has (its) moments, but they are few and far between.

... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental.
Brosnan's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes.
A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms, Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact.
To me, it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence, with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy.
Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often.
Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up.
ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted.
How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing? In truth, it has all the heart of a porno flick (but none of the sheer lust).
Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try.
Episode II-- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight.
The problem with all of this: It's not really funny.

Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste.

In all the annals of the movies, few films have been this odd, inexplicable and unpleasant.

The author's devotees will probably find it fascinating; others may find it baffling.
Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches, but wind up using them as punching bags.

A cockeyed shot all the way.
Lush and beautifully photographed (somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book), but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered.

For a film about explosions and death and spies, ``Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever'' seems as safe as a children's film. Well, in some of those, the mother deer even dies.

It's a hellish, numbing experience to watch, and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already, back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s.
Wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss BarberShop out of hand.
A few zingers aside, the writing is indifferent, and Jordan Brady's direction is prosaic.
Each scene drags, underscoring the obvious, and sentiment is slathered on top.
Would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story, and left off the film's predictable denouement. Then Nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all.
One of those staggeringly well-produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily.
Nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose, poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy.
Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions, Walt Becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons.
It's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge.
That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions, defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks.
What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers.
The project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting.
In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance, Ms. Shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick,' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast.
Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
Stitch is a bad mannered, ugly and destructive little ****. No cute factor here.... Not that I mind ugly; the problem is he has no character, loveable or otherwise.

A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film.
Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand.
It is bad, but certainly not without merit as entertainment.
For its 100 minutes running time, you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen.
A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse.
A faster paced family flick. Upper Teens may get cynical. Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy.

It's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns.
Most fish stories are a little peculiar, but this is one that should be thrown back in the river.
It's all gratuitous before long, as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story.
``I blame all men for war,'' (the warden's daughter) tells her father. The movie is about as deep as that sentiment.
It's fitfully funny but never really takes off.

...a low rate Annie featuring some kid who can't act, only echoes of Jordan, and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school.
It might not be 1970s animation, but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons – a retread story, bad writing, and the same old silliness.
The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush, swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain.

Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid...a curiously constricted epic.
It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has.
With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work, especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent, but as is, Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral.

A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp.
Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion.
It's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction.
A chilly, remote, emotionally distant piece...so dull that its tagline should be: 'In space, no one can hear you snore.'
The characters seem one-dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience.
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish, and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours.
It's like a drive-by. You can drive right by it without noticing anything special, save for a few comic turns, intended and otherwise.
Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized.
This would-be 'James Bond for the Extreme Generation' pic is one big, dumb action movie. Stress 'dumb.'
The movie has generic virtues, and despite a lot of involved talent, seems done by the numbers.
When your subject is illusion versus reality, shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real?

Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style.
There's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale.
As much as I laughed throughout the movie, I cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment, or even performance art, although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain.
The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the (teen comedy) genre a bad name.
Distinctly sub-par...more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine.
Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV's Dawson's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story.
Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm, you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party.
When the casting call for this movie went out, it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame.'
Just isn't as weird as it ought to be.
A ``Home Alone'' film that is staged like ``Rosemary's Baby,'' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films.

It's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love.
The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession, and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the ``webcast.''

Gets the look and the period trappings right, but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés.

They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film.

Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity.
It is so earnest, so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied.
These are textbook lives of quiet desperation.
Swimfan, like Fatal Attraction, eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub.
Claims to sort the bad guys from the good, which is its essential problem.
Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore, if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons.
Feels like pieces a bunch of other, better movies slapped together.
Almost everything about the film is unsettling, from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences.
Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew, and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic.
It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour, in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works, and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes.
One can't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney's latest album.
Phoned-in business as usual.
There's an epic here, but you have to put it together yourself.
What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting, macabre sets, and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else.
Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy, comin' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale.
Tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm, but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality.

Like a three-ring circus, there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable.
When in doubt, the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip. Or else a doggie winks.
A 'Girls Gone Wild' video for the boho art-house crowd, The Burning Sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that.
As original and insightful as last week's episode of Behind the Music.
Plays like John Le Carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders.
You may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie.

Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups: very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters.
What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points.
Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera...more salacious telenovela than serious drama.
Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory.
Even with Harris's strong effort, the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear's soul-stripping breakdown.
The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin.

While American Adobo has its heart (and its palate) in the right place, its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy, even.

It's coherent, well shot, and tartly acted, but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate.
Directed by Kevin Bray, whose crisp framing, edgy camera work, and wholesale ineptitude with acting, tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut.

Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role.
High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor, a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors, Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.
Set in a 1986 Harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in New York.
The chocolate factory without Charlie.
Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame.
Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture.
A dull, somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise.
Deserving of its critical backlash and more.
Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still, it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered.
The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context, which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots (or cinema seats).
The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams, even though her performance is more interesting (and funnier) than his.

No matter how you slice it, Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant, two cinematic icons with chemistry galore.
Godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess...In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating.
Humorless, self-conscious art drivel, made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention.
The movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error.'
Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say, but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me.
More tiring than anything.
Nelson's intentions are good, but the end result does no justice to the story itself. It's horribly depressing and not very well done.

A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast, but never quite gets off the ground.
Isn't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself? And it's a lousy one at that.

About Amy's cuteness, Amy's career success (she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself), and Amy's neuroses when it comes to men.
Everything about Girls Can't Swim, even its passages of sensitive observation, feels secondhand, familiar -- and not in a good way.
Feels aimless for much of its running time, until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives, leaving questions in its wake.
In my own very humble opinion, In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works.
The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue.
Muddled, simplistic and more than a little pretentious.
Meandering and glacially paced, and often just plain dull.
A disaster of a drama, saved only by its winged assailants.
A road trip that will get you thinking, 'Are we there yet?'
Director Elie Chouraqui, who co-wrote the script, catches the chaotic horror of war, but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera?
Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting, and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation.
If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon didn't have an original bone in his body, A Rumor of Angels should dispel it.
An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten.

An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism.
Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake, but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh.
This is a heartfelt story ... it just isn't a very involving one.
These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously, their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation.
The fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it.
Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material, but Lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold.
The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot... (but) from a mere story point of view, the film's ice cold.

The sequel is everything the original was not: contrived, overblown and tie-in ready.

One of the worst films of 2002.
I believe Silberling had the best intentions here, but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them.
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood.
McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious.
High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ Marine/legal mystery, and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff, nearly subliminally, as the old-hat province of male intrigue.
This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States.
The explosion essentially ruined -- or, rather, overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me.
This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn.
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people...manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy.
The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility.
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games, we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized.

A woefully dull, redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation, despite Iwai's vaunted empathy.
Screenwriter Chris ver Weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull, but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability.
If you really want to understand what this story is really all about, you're far better served by the source material.
It's mildly sentimental, unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable.
Like its title character, Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating.
The star who helped give a spark to ``Chasing Amy'' and ``Changing Lanes'' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer's new action film, ``The Sum of All Fears.''
A summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie, for that comes through all too painfully in the execution.
Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here.
Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause, trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey, but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this.
(The film's) taste for ``shock humor'' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers.
Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things.

Far more enjoyable than its predecessor.
(Gayton's script) telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience.

Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor, Sorority Boys is a bowser.
One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout, but a hundred of them can be numbing. Proof of this is Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever.

The lousy lead performances... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired.
Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious, and Schneider's performance is so fine, it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again, as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess.
(Creates) the worst kind of mythologizing, the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama.
The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation, and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates.
Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding.
A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks.
Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong. They cheapen the overall effect.

A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect.
Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games.
A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive.
Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors, sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent.
An unholy mess, driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape, it must be labelled 'hip', 'innovative' and 'realistic'.
The story's pathetic and the gags are puerile.

It plods along methodically, somehow under the assumption that its ``dead wife communicating from beyond the grave'' framework is even remotely new or interesting.

A very slow, uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel.
With little visible talent and no energy, Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee.

Well-meaning to a fault, Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy.

Attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and, dare I say, outdated, it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident.
Obvious, obnoxious and didactic burlesque.
The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters.
Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously.
Ultimately, clarity matters, both in breaking codes and making movies. Enigma lacks it.

A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie.
A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga.
Whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie, we cut to a new scene, which also appears to be the end. But, no, we get another scene, and then another. You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain.
An empty, ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility.

An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle.
It's unfortunate that Wallace, who wrote Gibson's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor, has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue.

This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations.
I have no problem with ``difficult'' movies, or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out. But first, you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
Been there, done that... a thousand times already, and better.

It never quite makes it to the boiling point, but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time.

I'm not sure which will take longer to heal: the welt on Johnny Knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche.
While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza, there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration.

Unspeakable, of course, barely begins to describe the plot and its complications. Vulgar is too optimistic a title.
The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene, but to diminishing effect. The characters never change.
If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth, there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows.
Welles groupie/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it, but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst.

The pace of the film is very slow (for obvious reasons) and that too becomes off-putting.
Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances, but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion, grief and fear.

Despite some comic sparks, Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire.
Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries, but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad, and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place.

Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency.

All the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition.

I liked the original short story but this movie, even at an hour and twenty-some minutes, it's too long and it goes nowhere.
This little film is so slovenly done, so primitive in technique, that it can't really be called animation.
Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours.
Hawke's film, a boring, pretentious waste of nearly two hours, doesn't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny, pathetic, starving and untalented artistes.

This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream.
Let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears.
A loud, brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy.
An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work, every bit as imperious as Katzenberg's The Prince of Egypt from 1998.
The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue, just because it seems obligatory.
The movie's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish.

...the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy.
Like most of Jaglom's films, some of it is honestly affecting, but more of it seems contrived and secondhand.
One long, numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before.
Forgettable, if good-hearted, movie.
The film's most improbable feat? It didn't go straight to video.
...about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season.
The Chateau... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters.
Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment... simultaneously degrades its characters, its stars and its audience.
It's not too fast and not too slow. It's not too racy and it's not too offensive. It's not too much of anything.
The great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash, and send it to its proper home.

Instead of using George and Lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks, Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere, seizing on George's haplessness and Lucy's personality tics.
Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable.
Becomes a bit of a mishmash: a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't.
Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance.
Grant isn't Cary and Bullock isn't Katherine.
Like a fish that's lived too long, Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places.
Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending.
Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom.
The entire movie is in need of a scented bath.
I'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not, nor will he be, back.
The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film, and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult.
A Movie to Forget
For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life, and its electronic expression through cyber culture, the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time.

Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights is 75 wasted minutes of Sandler as the voice-over hero in Columbia Pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie.
essentially ``Fatal Attraction'' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987. ...this story gets sillier, not scarier, as it goes along...

A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip.
Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon.
This Sade is hardly a perverse, dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama. He's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery, and the film seems as deflated as he does.
The film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9/11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind.
It's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream: ``Got AIDS yet?''
In a strange way, Egoyan has done too much. He's worked too hard on this movie.

A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns, expensive cars, lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing.

Sorority Boys, which is as bad at it is cruel, takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it.
Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming. Maybe there's a metaphor here, but figuring it out wouldn't make Trouble Every Day any better.
This is the first film I've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved.
Fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess.

It's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn.
The film's final hour, where nearly all the previous unseen material resides, is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut.
The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating.
I found it slow, predictable and not very amusing.
Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10,000 times.
Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess.

Sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy, and scotches most of its élan, humor, bile, and irony.
More busy than exciting, more frantic than involving, more chaotic than entertaining.
There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film. It's makes a better travelogue than movie.
It's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies, couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out, so he just slopped `em together here.
The fourth in a series that I'll bet most parents had thought --hoped! -- was a fad that had long since vanished.

Its premise is smart, but the execution is pretty weary.
The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired.
more precious than perspicacious
If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.

Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes.
Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary, humorless soap opera.

It's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick.
Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs.

Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf.

It's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good.

A dull, simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs, death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets.
The feature-length stretch ... strains the show's concept.

Fessenden continues to do interesting work, and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget. But the problem with Wendigo, for all its effective moments, isn't really one of resources.
Spirit is a visual treat, and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards, but it lacks a strong narrative.
It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins, who seem barely in the same movie. Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle.
This is a children's film in the truest sense. It's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message, so it's great for the kids. Parents, on the other hand, will be ahead of the plot at all times, and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen--and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that.
Tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with Kieslowski's lyrical pessimism; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski's work aspired to, including the condition of art.

You expect more from director Michael Apted (Enigma) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan (Reversal of Fortune) than this cliche pileup.
The first mistake, I suspect, is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student--where's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist?
The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny, and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving.
Replacing John Carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded, handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage. Of all the Halloween's, this is the most visually unappealing.
It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references.
Despite its dry wit and compassion, the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing.
...feels as if (there's) a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good, hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something.
Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama. He seems to want both, but succeeds in making neither.
I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again.
It's not a bad plot; but, unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from.
Girlfriends are bad, wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy.
The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants... who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds.
The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances, but the result is disappointing.
No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina.
Unfortunately, neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate.
A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung, but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily.
Bang! Zoom! It's actually pretty funny, but in all the wrong places.
Lurid and less than lucid work.
A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women.
At a brief 42 minutes, we need more X and less blab.
If anything, see it for Karen Black, who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick.

This is surely one of the most frantic, virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio.
Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand, even the funniest idea isn't funny.
A porn film without the sex scenes.
The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating, but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice.
A depressingly retrograde, 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women.
Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version (no more racist portraits of Indians, for instance), but the excitement is missing.
By the end, you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake Petrovich (that would be Reno) gets his comeuppance. Just bring on the Battle Bots, please!
While it's all quite tasteful to look at, the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own.
Broder's screenplay is shallow, offensive and redundant, with pitifully few real laughs.
Yes they can swim, the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through.
Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts, (very) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double (for Seagal).
Slow, silly and unintentionally hilarious.
The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste.
In a big corner office in Hell, Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender, is firing his R&D people, and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24/7.
For something as splendid-looking as this particular film, the viewer expects something special but instead gets (sci-fi) rehash.
A thriller without a lot of thrills.
This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror.
Ah, the travails of metropolitan life! Alas, another breathless movie about same!
In Moonlight Mile, no one gets shut out of the hug cycle.
Though uniformly well acted, especially by young Ballesta and Galan (a first-time actor), writer/director Achero Manas's film is schematic and obvious.
Done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment.
Despite its visual virtuosity, 'Naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it.
Slap her - she's not funny! No French people were harmed during the making of this movie, but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half.

``Not really as bad as you might think!''
Strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing.
One regards Reign of Fire with awe. What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea.
It has the right approach and the right opening premise, but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material.
Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation, which is way too stagy.
Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable, the director's experiment is a successful one.
The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish.
I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD.
An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it.

It just goes to show, an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller.
In a 102-minute film, Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time. ... most viewers will wish there had been more of the ``Queen'' and less of the ``Damned.''
Hopelessly inane, humorless and under-inspired.
Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for (or worth rooting against, for that matter).
It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it.
None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond, but much of it is good for a laugh. The problem with ``XXX'' is that its own action isn't very effective.
A great script brought down by lousy direction. Same guy with both hats. Big mistake.
A mediocre exercise in target demographics, unaware that it's the butt of its own joke.

In gleefully, thumpingly hyperbolic terms, it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass, jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz.
The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy.
Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis's wall of kitsch hard going.
According to Wendigo, 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves.
An encouraging effort from McCrudden
The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was, I would go back and choose to skip it. Fortunately, you still have that option.
Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment.
Adroit but finally a trifle flat, Mad Love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way, say, Jane Campion might have done, but at least it possesses some.
To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally.
This u-boat doesn't have a captain.
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge, (Crane) becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly, clinical lab report.
This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit.
Dull, a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song.
I walked away not really know who ``they'' were, what ``they'' looked like. Why ``they'' were here and what ``they'' wanted and quite honestly, I didn't care.
After several scenes of this tacky nonsense, you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions, especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget.
A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd, contrived, overblown, and entirely implausible finale.
The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea. But the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio. As for children, they won't enjoy the movie at all.
...you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already.
Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle's carpets.
It's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another.
The movie is genial but never inspired, and little about it will stay with you.
The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine.' But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless.
Despite the opulent lushness of every scene, the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings.
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene. What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test.
A bland, obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products.
..little action, almost no suspense or believable tension, one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic.
The movie strains to stay on the light, comic side of the issue, despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and, potentially, of life itself.
The Master of Disguise is awful. It's Pauly Shore awful. Don't say you weren't warned.
Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies...or any other John Woo flick for that matter.
The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments.
'Opening up' the play more has partly closed it down.
What (Frei) gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows.
An ugly, revolting movie.

The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn, and the nicest thing I can say is that I can't remember a single name responsible for it.
Watching ``Ending'' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale. You can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff.
Certainly beautiful to look at, but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic.
It desperately wants to be a wacky, screwball comedy, but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time.
The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout?
From the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line, ``Besotted'' is misbegotten
My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack.
A film that presents an interesting, even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations.
Filled with low-brow humor, gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life.
directed in a flashy, empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
The 70-year-old Godard has become, to judge from In Praise of Love, the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them.
An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously.
Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision, but that vision is beginning to feel, if not morally bankrupt, at least terribly monotonous.
Harvard Man is a semi-throwback, a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality.
Supposedly based upon real, or at least soberly reported incidents, the film ends with a large human tragedy. Alas, getting there is not even half the interest.
While Hoffman's performance is great, the subject matter goes nowhere.
The smash 'em-up, crash 'em-up, shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense.
Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory, where it plainly has no business going.
Hart's War seems to want to be a character study, but apparently can't quite decide which character.
Theological matters aside, the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues.
This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff, demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent, well-made B movie is long gone.
Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama.
Been there, done that, liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional.

Burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off.
While this one gets off with a good natured warning, future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting.
Too much of the movie feels contrived, as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks.
It's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie. And it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it.
The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke's artistic aspirations, but he hasn't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul.
The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture, but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much.
Why sit through a crummy, wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies, when you could just rent those movies instead, let alone seek out a respectable new one?
The obnoxious special effects, the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant, so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy, dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm.
Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair.
The movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality. It doesn't really know or care about the characters, and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events.
All mood and no movie.
Press the delete key.
Simone is not a bad film. It just doesn't have anything really interesting to say.
Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy, the film becomes predictably conventional.
...hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around. Wait to see it then.
There's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer. Or for the year, for that matter.
Lacks the spirit of the previous two, and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck.
This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again, even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book.
Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie, not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke. Over and over again.
The threat implied in the title Pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming.

To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it.
Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were.
The film falls short on tension, eloquence, spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries.
By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen, even though I could not stand them. Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter. It's not an easy one to review.
At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd. But it would be better to wait for the video. And a very rainy day.
The whole talking-animal thing is grisly.
Never Again, while nothing special, is pleasant, diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction.
Wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II? Um, no. But here's a movie about it anyway.
Has not so much been written as assembled, Frankenstein-like, out of other, marginally better shoot-em-ups.
The punch lines that miss, unfortunately, outnumber the hits by three-to-one. But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end.
Mushes the college-friends genre (The Big Chill) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas.
Showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment. Those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves. But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro.
A determined, ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird.

Woody, what happened?

It's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah.
You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood isn't going to jell.
Throughout all the tumult, a question comes to mind: So why is this so boring?
Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work.
Routine and rather silly.

Lazy filmmaking, with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling.

A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire.
How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any? On the evidence before us, the answer is clear: Not easily and, in the end, not well enough.

Lyne's latest, the erotic thriller Unfaithful, further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded.
It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss, and that's more or less how it plays out.
Rumor, a muddled drama about coming to terms with death, feels impersonal, almost generic.
Report card: Doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement. Doesn't deserve a passing grade (even on a curve).
The pacing is deadly, the narration helps little and Naipaul, a juicy writer, is negated.
As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says 'I'm telling you, this is f***ed'. Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience.
...if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special, the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes, it drags.
Bean drops the ball too many times... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay.
A well-acted, but one-note film.
Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood's Dirty Harry period.
The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications.
(Lee) treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb, credulous, unassuming, subordinate subjects. And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring, wide-smiling reception.

No amount of burning, blasting, stabbing, and shooting can hide a weak script.
It's an odd show, pregnant with moods, stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise.
Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here.
The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment.

Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be.
When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie, you know the picture is in trouble.
This is very much of a mixed bag, with enough negatives to outweigh the positives.
Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue.
Whether it's the worst movie of 2002, I can't say for sure: Memories of Rollerball have faded, and I skipped Country Bears. But this new jangle of noise, mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title.
(A) boldly stroked, luridly coloured, uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain.
Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings; to me, it was just a matter of 'eh.'
Rollerball IS as bad as you think, and worse than you can imagine.
The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it. We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce, because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low.
Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks, college flicks, or even flicks in general. It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them.

Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic, extreme-sports adventure, but ends up more of a creaky ``Pretty Woman'' retread, with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought.
This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101.
What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie. In other words, it's badder than bad.

A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.
A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis.
Where the film falters is in its tone.
The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head.
Ultimately, Sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic, and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness.
It's supposed to be a humorous, all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up.

Nothing but an episode of Smackdown! in period costume and with a bigger budget.
It takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before, but beneath the exotic surface (and exotic dancing) it's surprisingly old-fashioned.
While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it's based upon, Queen Of The Damned is a pointless, meandering celebration of the goth-vampire, tortured woe-is-me lifestyle.
It should be interesting, it should be poignant, it turns out to be affected and boring.
A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance.
A tired, predictable, bordering on offensive, waste of time, money and celluloid.
If Hill isn't quite his generation's Don Siegel (or Robert Aldrich), it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair; it's all bluster and cliché.
Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet, swipe 90 minutes of your time, and offer you precisely this in recompense: A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious.

Competently directed but terminally cute drama.
The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing.

This thing is virtually unwatchable.
Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time. Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen.

The sort of picture in which, whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do, they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset.
Aptly named, this shimmering, beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me.
A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958.
Has none of the crackle of ``Fatal Attraction'', ``9 ½ Weeks'', or even ``Indecent Proposal'', and feels more like Lyne's stolid remake of ``Lolita''.
Everything its title implies, a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line.
An extraordinarily silly thriller.
A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade.
Gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth.
Talkiness isn't necessarily bad, but the dialogue frequently misses the mark.
The beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of (Godard's) vision, any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice.

The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama: What would you have done to survive? The problem with the film is whether these ambitions, laudable in themselves, justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau.
... for all its social and political potential, State Property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful.
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time, and this isn't.
Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true, but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable.
The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome, with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations.
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking: joyless, idiotic, annoying, heavy-handed, visually atrocious, and often downright creepy.
This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Amélie.
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue

Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong.
Koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own.
Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets?
More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex, dramatically satisfying heroine
Clumsy, obvious, preposterous, the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades.
It's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss. Rather, pity anyone who sees this mishmash.
A banal, virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy.
The drama discloses almost nothing.
A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard.
Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category, and this is why I have given it a one-star rating.

Even fans of Ismail Merchant's work, I suspect, would have a hard time sitting through this one.
It's really just another silly Hollywood action film, one among a multitude of simple-minded, yahoo-ing death shows.
It's not a particularly good film, but neither is it a monsterous one.
The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese. But it doesn't need Gangs of New York.
Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing, however, is the edge of wild, lunatic invention that we associate with Cage's best acting.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again, and while that is a cliche, nothing could be more appropriate. It's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one.
Sade achieves the near-impossible: It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard.
(Lin Chung's) voice is rather unexceptional, even irritating (at least to this Western ear), making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters.
One of the most plain, unimaginative romantic comedies I've ever seen.
Though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction, the drama feels rigged and sluggish.
Unfortunately, the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making.

It should be doing a lot of things, but doesn't.
Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent, indie trick in the book.

The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart.
Rather than real figures, Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world.
Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls.
It's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that, have at it.
I suspect that you'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it. If you go, pack your knitting needles.
The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma. We don't even like their characters.
Some writer dude, I think his name was, uh, Michael Zaidan, was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something, but, dude, the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck.
The movie doesn't generate a lot of energy. It is dark, brooding and slow, and takes its central idea way too seriously.
This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning.
It feels like very light Errol Morris, focusing on eccentricity but failing, ultimately, to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs.
A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell.
The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired. Pair that with really poor comedic writing...and you've got a huge mess.
Proves a lovely trifle that, unfortunately, is a little too in love with its own cuteness.
Did we really need a remake of ``Charade?''
Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes: a setup, delivery and payoff. Stealing Harvard can't even do that much. Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth.
The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game. You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored.
I spied with my little eye...a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics, but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel.
The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying.
Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is.
an ``O Bruin, Where Art Thou?''-style cross-country adventure... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness, some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack.
A feeble Tootsie knockoff.
An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers.
...the story is far-flung, illogical, and plain stupid.
The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary.
An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing, but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message.
A very familiar tale, one that's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian-, Chinese-, Irish-, Latin-, Indian-, Russian- and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages.
One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out.
Essentially, the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
A relentless, bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick.
(Hell is) looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara isn't even halfway through.
Too long, and larded with exposition, this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community.

...a ho-hum affair, always watchable yet hardly memorable.
Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell.

An inept, tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures, it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch, and no more.
It's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition.
Absolutely (and unintentionally) terrifying.
Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring.
Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof.
No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus, accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way.

Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star, but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation.
Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda.
Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation. How about surprising us by trying something new?
Final verdict: You've seen it all before.
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth, Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material.
If A Few Good Men told us that we ``can't handle the truth'' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we ``don't care about the truth.''
Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer, director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run, has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap.
You'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy.
The movie is a little tired; maybe the original inspiration has run its course.
This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things.
A full-frontal attack on audience patience.
Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy, there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors.
It's a big idea, but the film itself is small and shriveled.
Debut effort by ``Project Greenlight'' winner is sappy and amateurish.
One gets the impression the creators of Don't Ask Don't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes. Too bad none of it is funny.
The cast has a high time, but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp.
The film, like Jimmy's routines, could use a few good laughs.
The film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing, but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies.

The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork.
Cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film.

Hey Arnold! is now stretched to barely feature length, with a little more attention paid to the animation. Still, the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett's story is appealing.
True to its title, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at.
Doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago.
The plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours.
Kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious.

The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing.
Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped, they prove more distressing than suspenseful.
In this film we at least see a study in contrasts; the wide range of one actor, and the limited range of a comedian.

More intellectually scary than dramatically involving.
An inconsequential, barely there bit of piffle.

As saccharine as it is disposable.
You come away thinking not only that Kate isn't very bright, but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she, Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another.
The metaphors are provocative, but too often, the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery.
Very much a home video, and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all.
Too much power, not enough puff.
The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show.
It's provocative stuff, but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that Hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances.
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains...Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential.
Muddled, trashy and incompetent
For this sort of thing to work, we need agile performers, but the proficient, dull Sorvino has no light touch, and Rodan is out of his league.
Narc is all menace and atmosphere.
Though excessively tiresome, The Uncertainty Principle, as verbally pretentious as the title may be, has its handful of redeeming features, as long as you discount its ability to bore.
Despite Juliet Stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela's emotional roller coaster life, it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs.

his (Nelson's) screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma, rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it.

A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving.
There are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them.
As it stands, Crocodile Hunter has the hurried, badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla, which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction.
The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie.
Enigma is well-made, but it's just too dry and too placid.
``Sweet Home Alabama'' is what it is – a nice, harmless date film...
One of the best, most understated performances of (Jack Nicholson's) career.
The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true.
It's a masterpiece.
It may not be ``Last Tango in Paris'' but...
They crush each other under cars, throw each other out windows, electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness. And we don't avert our eyes for a moment.
Charming and funny (but ultimately silly) movie.
Third time's the charm...yeah, baby!
A pleasant, if forgettable, romp of a film.
By the end of the movie, you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular.

As a film director, LaBute continues to improve.
Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it.
Catch it... if you can!
Worse than 'Silence of the Lambs' better than 'Hannibal'
American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature, but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone.
'Possession,' based on the book by A.S. Byatt, demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit

Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience.
The script is smart, not cloying.
Visually, 'Santa Clause 2' is wondrously creative.
A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception, which, while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces, is still very much worth seeing.
One fantastic (and educational) documentary.
An ambitious 'what if?' that works.
``The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'' has flaws, but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
Nice piece of work.
'Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall's intense freight train of a film.'
It's funny, as the old saying goes, because it's true.
Though the film is static, its writer-director's heart is in the right place, his plea for democracy and civic action laudable.
The filmmaker's heart is in the right place...

Apart from anything else, this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen.
Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and, hence, more chillingly effective.

By turns pretentious, fascinating, ludicrous, provocative and vainglorious.
I can't recommend it. But it's surprisingly harmless.
What's next? The Porky's Revenge: Ultimate Edition?
The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish.
There's no real reason to see it, and no real reason not to.
Is ``Ballistic'' worth the price of admission? Absolutely not. It sucked. Would I see it again? Please see previous answer.
It's exactly what you'd expect.
``The Kid Stays in the Picture'' is a great story, terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat.
A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell.
The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted.
This isn't a movie; it's a symptom.
What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless, vapid and devoid of substance, in a movie that is definitely meaningless, vapid and devoid of substance.
If only it were, well, funnier.
The script? Please.
Doesn't add up to much.
One of the worst movies of the year.
A complete waste of time.
