2231	As gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an Asian landscape painting .
2232	Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .
2233	Gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth .
2234	The hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the Sally Jesse Raphael atmosphere of films like Philadelphia and American Beauty .
2235	It 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but Olympia , Wash. , based filmmakers Anne de Marcken and Marilyn Freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting .
2236	A memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .
2237	Executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted Scrooge could fail to respond .

2253	A film of ideas and wry comic mayhem .
2254	At its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .
2255	A worthwhile documentary , whether you 're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll .
2256	Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .

2268	Isabelle Huppert excels as the enigmatic Mika and Anna Mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of Chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries .

2293	Sometimes shorter is better .
2294	Phillip Noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , Christopher Doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of Greene 's prose , and it 's there on the screen in their version of The Quiet American .
2295	The film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .
2296	As a vehicle to savour Binoche 's skill , the film is well worthwhile .
2297	The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent .

2435	In his U.S. debut , Mr. Schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist .
2436	Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .
2437	Rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , Jiang Wen 's Devils on the Doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut .
2438	Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .
2439	A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others .

3061	Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .

3092	Got a David Lynch jones ?

3094	Astonishing ... -LRB- frames -RRB- profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment .

3112	A sensitive , cultivated treatment of Greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one .

3143	Takashi Miike keeps pushing the envelope : Ichi the Killer

3360	borrows a bit from the classics `` Wait Until Dark '' and `` Extremities '' ... But in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself .
3361	Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .

3390	Beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm .

3407	every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that I usually dread encountering the most - The Fanboy

3421	Solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .

3441	A smart , compelling drama .
3442	A must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .

3466	An original little film about one young woman 's education .

3504	The filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching .

3622	The IMAX screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation .

3624	It 's all about Anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
3625	Lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience .

3627	It 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot .
3628	Its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch .
3629	A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .
3630	The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
3631	It 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .
3632	Brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life .

3638	Nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : He is n't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction .
3639	It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
3640	Secret Ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving .
3641	Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , Dogtown and Z-Boys has a compelling story to tell .
3642	It 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like .
3643	Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .

3657	A keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters .

3660	A hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look .
3661	The Last Kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of My Big Fat Greek Wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact .

3663	The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .
3664	Sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people .
3665	There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .

3670	Fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd .
3671	One of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace .
3672	The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .
3673	And Vin Diesel is the man .
3674	Earnest , unsubtle and Hollywood-predictable , Green Dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of Vietnamese .
3675	An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .
3676	Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .

3678	Entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn .
3679	Despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .
3680	Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , Metropolis is a feast for the eyes .
3681	Sweetly sexy , funny and touching .
3682	... while Dark Water is n't a complete wash -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- , watched side-by-side with Ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .
3683	Is truth stranger than fiction ?
3684	In -LRB- screenwriter -RRB- Charlie Kaufman 's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking .

3691	Together writer-director Danny Verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .
3692	Bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .
3693	Its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story .
3694	In other words , it 's just another sports drama\/character study .
3695	Yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness .
3696	Plus , like I already mentioned ... it 's Robert Duvall !
3697	C'mon !
3698	This story of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments .

3700	A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .
3701	It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho-Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .
3702	Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but Coppola , along with his sister , Sofia , is a real filmmaker .
3703	It must be in the genes .
3704	The performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .
3705	This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon .
3706	Hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the U.S. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema .

3708	The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .
3709	Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year .
3710	It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
3711	Colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , Burkinabe filmmaker Dani Kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory .
3712	It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
3713	Director Paul Cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding .
3714	For 95 often hilarious minutes , -LRB- Cho -RRB- riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outrÃ© sexual practice .
3715	Most of the things that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure are still there .
3716	Mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully .
3717	Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events .
3718	Those seeking a definitive account of Eisenstein 's life would do better elsewhere .
3719	-LRB- Westbrook -RRB- makes a wonderful subject for the camera .
3720	A film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .
3721	Even if Invincible is not quite the career peak that The Pianist is for Roman Polanski , it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .
3722	Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
3723	Hardly a film that comes along every day .
3724	A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .
3725	The film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of Abagnale 's antics .
3726	A sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old Welsh boy more curious about God than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter .
3727	the film belongs to the marvelous Verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
3728	More intimate than spectacular , E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
3729	For once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .
3730	If you 're burnt out on It 's a Wonderful Life marathons and bored with A Christmas Carol , it might just be the movie you 're looking for .
3731	It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept .
3732	Moonlight Mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .
3733	It is an indelible epic American story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .
3734	Not as well-written as Sexy Beast , not as gloriously flippant as Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted .
3735	Quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to .
3736	A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .
3737	The filmmakers wisely decided to let Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him .
3738	A winning and wildly fascinating work .
3739	We do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close .
3740	Worth catching for Griffiths ' warm and winning central performance .
3741	The tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .
3742	An interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama .
3743	A meatier deeper beginning and\/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the `` A '' range , as is , it 's a very very strong `` B + . ''
3744	I love the robust middle of this picture .

3749	It is up to you to decide if you need to see it .
3750	If Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances .
3751	If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad .
3752	There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .
3753	Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior , it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .
3754	An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .
3755	Samuel Beckett applied to the Iranian voting process .
3756	The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .
3757	Another trumpet blast that there may be a New Mexican Cinema a-bornin ' . '
3758	... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '

3762	It is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one .
3763	Trapped wo n't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
3764	A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .
3765	It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
3766	Just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective .
3767	As they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , Signs is a tribute to Shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
3768	There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .
3769	Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
3770	A film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story .

4570	Shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
4571	Where Janice Beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .
4572	Byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle .
4573	Instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground .
4574	McGrath has deftly trimmed Dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness .

4576	Metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story .
4577	As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso , Sia lacks visual flair .
4578	But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .
4579	The best comedy concert movie I 've seen since Cho 's previous concert comedy film , I 'm the One That I Want , in 2000 .

4592	Noyce 's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , Hollywood moments to keep us
4593	World Traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .
4594	There 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all .
4595	There 's absolutely no reason why Blue Crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
4596	An action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of Day of the Jackal , The French Connection , and Heat .
4597	The best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites .
4598	In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .
4599	Insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either .
4600	classic cinema served up with heart and humor
4601	-LRB- Stephen -RRB- Earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have .
4602	The events of the film are just so WEIRD that I honestly never knew what the hell was coming next .
4603	Nicole Holofcener 's Lovely and Amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style .
4604	That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .
4605	Has a solid emotional impact .
4606	Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie .
4607	Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .
4608	While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .
4609	Raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings .

4612	If you 've the patience , there are great rewards here .
4613	As a science fiction movie , `` Minority Report '' astounds .
4614	Watching E.T now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .
4615	Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure .
4616	Chris Columbus ' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original .

4618	The dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . '
4619	... a great , participatory spectator sport . '
4620	A rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and Japanese animation .
4621	Believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half .
4622	But arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us .
4623	Adam SANDLER !
4624	In an ART FILM !
4625	As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .
4626	Stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .
4627	... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations .
4628	The hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight .
4629	Over the years , Hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and Ice Age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor .
4630	Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
4631	One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .
4632	One of the most original American productions this year , you 'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a Sunshine State .

4637	Admirers of director Abel Ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , R Xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .
4638	The slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
4639	A worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .
4640	Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .
4641	The kind of primal storytelling that George Lucas can only dream of .
4642	Even if The Ring has a familiar ring , it 's still unusually crafty and intelligent for Hollywood horror .
4643	The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame .
4644	A solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration .
4645	The cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting Mick Jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
4646	An entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie .
4647	It has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out .
4648	An enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences ... The ChÃ¢teau is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten .

4660	His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories .
4661	If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .

4664	Highly irritating at first , Mr. Koury 's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results .
4665	About Schmidt belongs to Nicholson .
4666	Gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances .
4667	As Schmidt , Nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance .
4668	The powder blues and sun-splashed whites of Tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs .

4670	It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .
4671	If it 's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch .

4674	-LRB- Ferrera -RRB- has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .
4675	... the plot weaves us into a complex web .
4676	Do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .
4677	In Death to Smoochy , we do n't get Williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing .
4678	A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .
4679	Fortunately , Elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry .

4685	A funny , triumphant , and moving documentary .
4686	Lathan and Diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest .
4687	About Schmidt is Nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing King Lear .
4688	A confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design .
4689	Gay or straight , Kissing Jessica Stein is one of the greatest date movies in years .
4690	This is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope .
4691	Even better than the first one !
4692	Its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy .
4693	A must see for all sides of the political spectrum
4694	-LRB- Reynolds -RRB- takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .
4695	There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .
4696	Rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .
4697	Has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .
4698	It rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide .
4699	Though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further Oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone .
4700	This humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of Zhao Benshan and the delicate ways of Dong Jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore . '
4701	It will break your heart many times over .
4702	A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .
4703	Overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very Imaxy .
4704	This is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it .
4705	`` Secretary '' is owned by its costars , Spader and Gyllenhaal .
4706	Maggie G. makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen .
4707	The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .
4708	Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .
4709	The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .
4710	Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .
4711	The story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there 's a certain style and wit to the dialogue .
4712	The music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and Italy beckons us all .
4713	The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose .
4714	The film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .
4715	Jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
4716	Happy Times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it .
4717	Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition .
4718	One of the pleasures in Walter 's documentary ... is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject 's mysterious personality without ever explaining him .
4719	Captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world .
4720	He 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer .
4721	`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .
4722	And , there 's no way you wo n't be talking about the film once you exit the theater .
4723	If I have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story -LRB- like , say , Treasure Planet -RRB- or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , I 'll take the latter every time .
4724	Quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that is n't afraid to admit it does n't have all the answers .
4725	In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
4726	Some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat .
4727	It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .
4728	The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
4729	Y Tu MamÃ¡ TambiÃ©n is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than Georgia asphalt .
4730	... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .
4731	You come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated .
4732	If the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , Jacquot preserves Tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .
4733	Thirteen Conversations About One Thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a Mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
4734	Overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .
4735	A must for fans of British cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride .
4736	Tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of Yasujiro Ozu .
4737	Until -LRB- the -RRB- superfluous ... epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , Die Another Day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any James Bond thriller .
4738	It 's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true ` epic ' .
4739	All the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost .
4740	The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .
4741	A touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli .
4742	The ending feels at odds with the rest of the film .
4743	A tone of rueful compassion ... reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events .
4744	A beautiful paean to a time long past .
4745	Dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed .
4746	If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you 've seen him eight stories tall .
4747	With this masterful , flawless film , -LRB- Wang -RRB- emerges in the front ranks of China 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers .
4748	Shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to Earth for harvesting purposes .
4749	This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
4750	A different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling .
4751	Splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity .
4752	A compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day .
4753	She 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations .
4754	To those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much .
4755	Even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .
4756	A thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .
4757	It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .
4758	Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans and Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about .
4759	Touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants .
4760	A wildly entertaining scan of Evans ' career .
4761	A mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director 's travel through 300 years of Russian history .
4762	Boldly engineering a collision between tawdry B-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , Rose 's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer .
4763	A finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere .
4764	The Salton Sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety .
4765	Both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes .
4766	Although shot with little style , Skins is heartfelt and achingly real .
4767	Harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research .
4768	Upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .
4769	A very pretty after-school special .
4770	It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it .
4771	A harrowing account of a psychological breakdown .
4772	Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means .
4773	It certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .
4774	Dog Soldiers does n't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it .
4775	At once emotional and richly analytical , the Cosby-Seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary .
4776	It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .
4777	` Alice 's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land ' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures .
4778	Without -LRB- De Niro -RRB- , City By The Sea would slip under the waves .
4779	He drags it back , single-handed .
4780	A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .
4781	If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat .
4782	... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
4783	The film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for Gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her .
4784	Broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary .
4785	He thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject .
4786	At its best when the guarded , resentful Betty and the manipulative yet needy Margot are front and center .
4787	Gloriously straight from the vagina .
4788	It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .
4789	The film oozes craft .
4790	Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .
4791	Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .
4792	A classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached .
4793	It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of Sarah and Harrison .
4794	a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
4795	Jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used .
4796	Recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat .
4797	Washington overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration .
4798	The film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... This makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .
4799	A searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise .
4800	Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially San Francisco lovers -- it 's a spirited film and a must-see .
4801	Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love .
4802	The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is .
4803	while -LRB- Roman Coppola -RRB- scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .
4804	Any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look .
4805	It may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but I enjoyed Barbershop .
4806	It 's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters .
4807	A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of World War II through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .
4808	It 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .
4809	A perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little Lilo & Stitch had in spades -- charisma .
4810	Beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of Grenoble and Geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself .
4811	Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt .
4812	That 's why Sex and Lucia is so alluring .
4813	An elegant work , Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing .
4814	Although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of Spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching .
4815	A behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that 's made a difference to NYC inner-city youth .
4816	A brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on Hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .
4817	A powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution .
4818	In its own floundering way , it gets to you .
4819	Just like Igby .
4820	Return to Never Land may be another shameless attempt by Disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it 's not half-bad .
4821	Wise and deadpan humorous .
4822	God bless Crudup and his aversion to taking the easy Hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness .
4823	If Signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .
4824	Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .
4825	Schrader examines Crane 's decline with unblinking candor .
4826	You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .
4827	It thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -LRB- Jaglom -RRB- pursued with such enervating determination in Venice\/Venice .
4828	This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .
4829	Sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .
4830	Cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh .
4831	Not as good as the original , but what is ...

5374	The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .
5375	My Wife 's plotting is nothing special ; it 's the delivery that matters here .
5376	I 've yet to find an actual Vietnam War combat movie actually produced by either the North or South Vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close .
5377	A moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
5378	It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects .
5379	It 's like Rocky and Bullwinkle on Speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness .
5380	As action-adventure , this space-based homage to Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island fires on all plasma conduits .
5381	A melancholy , emotional film .
5382	While the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you wo n't care .
5383	Intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
5384	Goofy , nutty , consistently funny .
5385	And educational !
5386	Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it .
5387	It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .
5388	The film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .
5389	Beautifully directed and convincingly acted .
5390	Gambling and throwing a basketball game for money is n't a new plot -- in fact Toback himself used it in Black and White .
5391	But Toback 's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again .
5392	In the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes .
5393	Bring on the sequel .
5394	Graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in American teen comedies .
5395	If we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like Tim McCann 's Revolution No. 9 .
5396	The film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .
5397	A big-budget\/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as The Hours is a distinct rarity , and an event .
5398	... certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes .
5399	But something seems to be missing .
5400	A sense of real magic , perhaps .
5401	That Haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .
5402	The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .
5403	... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages ...
5404	Plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision .
5405	Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ?
5406	Do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man 's body ?
5407	If you answered yes , by all means enjoy The New Guy .
5408	The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .
5409	Missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane .
5410	An indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh .
5411	Steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic .
5412	The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion .
5413	Made-Up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on America 's skin-deep notions of pulchritude .
5414	Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking .
5415	Ya-Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .
5416	The film 's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen .
5417	The artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from Japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
5418	The picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .
5419	The modern remake of Dumas 's story is long on narrative and -LRB- too -RRB- short on action .
5420	Fred Schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen .
5421	With a cast of A-list Brit actors , it is worth searching out .
5422	Suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers .
5423	Nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , Warm Water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy .
5424	It 's like an old Warner Bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie Errol Flynn always wanted to make , though Bette Davis , cast as Joan , would have killed him .
5425	It 's a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX .
5426	Satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time .
5427	Oh , James !
5428	Your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , Madonna 's cameo does n't suck !
5429	That death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world 's religions .
5430	This deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications .
5431	There is something that is so meditative and lyrical about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian drama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of Middle Eastern world politics
5432	A huge box-office hit in Korea , Shiri is a must for genre fans .
5433	I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming .
5434	The symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees .
5435	I wanted more .
5436	If it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with Ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .
5437	The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful .
5438	Red Dragon makes one appreciate Silence of the Lambs .
5439	Proves a servicable World War II drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem Hollywood too long has ignored .
5440	Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .
5441	While Broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .
5442	... strips Bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults .
5443	Laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma .
5444	Tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .
5445	A solidly entertaining little film .
5446	It 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space .
5447	Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
5448	Despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances .
5449	A passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action .
5450	Though Nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
5451	A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us .
5452	From both a great and a terrible story , Mr. Nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .
5453	Spider-Man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units .
5454	The first shocking thing about Sorority Boys is that it 's actually watchable .
5455	Even more baffling is that it 's funny .
5456	Highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring Ice-T in a major role .
5457	Neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest Attal and Gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm .
5458	First and foremost ... the reason to go see `` Blue Crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by David Hennings .
5459	A visionary marvel , but it 's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this .
5460	The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .
5461	In his latest effort , Storytelling , Solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good .
5462	How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood .
5463	It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .
5464	I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .
5465	What 's most memorable about Circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb .
5466	Scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar .
5467	Yes , soar .
5468	A delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a Copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them .
5469	`` What really happened ? ''
5470	is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience .
5471	Soderbergh , like Kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit .
5472	Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .
5473	Their work is fantastic .
5474	Crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half .
5475	Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic .
5476	Tsai Ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film , What Time Is It There ?
5477	, is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly .
5478	The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List .
5479	But Mr. Polanski creates images even more haunting than those in Mr. Spielberg 's 1993 classic .
5480	Steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .
5481	A brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium .
5482	As warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated .
5483	The film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in .
5484	Old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment .
5485	An energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching -LRB- or turntablism -RRB- in particular .
5486	A fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` It 's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
5487	If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change .
5488	I had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was Earnest .
5489	Even though the film does n't manage to hit all of its marks , it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice .
5490	Where This was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , That is even lazier and far less enjoyable .
5491	The 3-D vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry .
5492	The attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
5493	Fans of the modern day Hong Kong action film finally have the worthy successor to A Better Tomorrow and The Killer which they have been patiently waiting for .
5494	Even when he 's not at his most critically insightful , Godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work .
5495	What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .
5496	Has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested .
5497	This seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done .
5498	It 's a scorcher .
5499	Bittersweet comedy\/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable Italian guys .
5500	Works as pretty contagious fun .
5501	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
5502	A realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales .
5503	A charming , banter-filled comedy ... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface .
5504	A film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers .
5505	Serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that The Road to Perdition leads to a satisfying destination .
5506	Heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart .
5507	Caruso sometimes descends into sub-Tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure The Salton Sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty .
5508	A `` black Austin Powers ? ''
5509	I prefer to think of it as `` Pootie Tang with a budget . ''
5510	Sa da TAY !
5511	Oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny .
5512	I would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .
5513	Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . '
5514	The best thing I can say about this film is that I ca n't wait to see what the director does next .
5515	Smarter than its commercials make it seem .
5516	One of the funnier movies in town .
5517	Campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over Rafael 's evolution .
5518	By turns very dark and very funny .
5519	Steven Soderbergh does n't remake Andrei Tarkovsky 's Solaris so much as distill it .
5520	For more than two decades Mr. Nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity .
5521	Simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad .
5522	Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown 's life .
5523	The philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film 's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable .
5524	Not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet .
5525	Director Lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve .
5526	As Allen 's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator David Presson .
5527	Jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .
5528	A vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish .
5529	If S&M seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -LRB- and its makers ' -RRB- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves .
5530	If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .
5531	One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .
5532	... an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle .
5533	An engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller .
5534	It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalrymple 's film earn their uplift .
5535	Mel Gibson fights the good fight in Vietnam in director Randall Wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency .
5536	There 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence .
5537	A brutal and funny work .
5538	Nicole Holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .
5539	The film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring Kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .
5540	One of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old Walt doodled Steamboat Willie .
5541	Move over Bond ; this girl deserves a sequel .
5542	The kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . .
5543	It 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries .
5544	There 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls ...
5545	Tells -LRB- the story -RRB- with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot 's persnickety problems is simply a matter of -LRB- being -RRB- in a shrugging mood .
5546	The film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor .
5547	If The Man from Elysian Fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out .
5548	What emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice .
5549	Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish .
5550	Meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .
5551	Hey , Happy !
5552	is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it 's a love story as sanguine as its title .
5553	You wo n't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again .
5554	At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .
5555	There is a general air of exuberance in All About The Benjamins that 's hard to resist .
5556	A lovably old-school Hollywood confection .
5557	I 'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes .
5558	By turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , Laissez-passer has all the earmarks of French cinema at its best .
5559	The warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .
5560	Wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message .
5561	A quirky comedy set in Newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that 's so prevalent on The Rock .
5562	Peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments .
5563	I 'd rather watch a rerun of The Powerpuff Girls
5564	With the prospect of films like Kangaroo Jack about to burst across America 's winter movie screens it 's a pleasure to have a film like The Hours as an alternative .
5565	The wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic .
5566	Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .
5567	As a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , Sex with Strangers is a success .
5568	unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
5569	Spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but `` Spider-Man '' certainly delivers the goods .
5570	Other than the slightly flawed -LRB- and fairly unbelievable -RRB- finale , everything else is top shelf .
5571	This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .
5572	Manages to delight without much of a story .
5573	There 's no denying that Burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him .
5574	I have a confession to make : I did n't particularly like E.T. the first time I saw it as a young boy .
5575	That is because - damn it !
5576	- I also wanted a little alien as a friend !
5577	Fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm .
5578	A genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .
5579	Though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .
5580	An energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is n't .
5581	A violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for Angelique , the -LRB- opening -RRB- dance guarantees Karmen 's enthronement among the cinema 's memorable women .
5582	An animation landmark as monumental as Disney 's 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs .
5583	An entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .
5584	Sex With Strangers is fascinating ...
5585	A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .
5586	A wry , affectionate delight .
5587	The acting in Pauline And Paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is Debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons .
5588	One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .
5589	A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic .
5590	Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .
5591	And adults will at least have a dream image of the West to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle .
5592	Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
5593	Less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself .
5594	waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it .
5595	Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness , but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments .
5596	If Borstal Boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .
5597	Often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .
5598	The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .
5599	Maggie Smith as the Ya-Ya member with the O2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment .
5600	This is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style .
5601	Although I did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either .
5602	It can be safely recommended as a video\/DVD babysitter .
5603	Another Best of the Year selection .
5604	The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .
5605	It 's a very valuable film ...
5606	Max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished .
5607	Literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds .
5608	Here Polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably .
5609	The story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday .
5610	A compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds .
5611	With `` Ichi the Killer '' , Takashi Miike , Japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than Batman ...
5612	You never know where Changing Lanes is going to take you but it 's a heck of a ride .
5613	Samuel L. Jackson is one of the best actors there is .
5614	-LRB- Breheny 's -RRB- lensing of the New Zealand and Cook Island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people .
5615	An almost unbearably morbid love story .
5616	The Wild Thornberrys Movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate .
5617	A forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself .
5618	Spielberg 's realization of a near-future America is masterful .
5619	This makes Minority Report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever .
5620	The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .
5621	The best film of the year 2002 .
5622	An enthralling , entertaining feature .
5623	Stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , LaBute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection .
5624	A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .
5625	All in all , Brown Sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted .
5626	It will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face .
5627	Smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise .
5628	Working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by Gianni Romoli ... Ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up .
5629	An older cad instructs a younger lad in Zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy .
5630	`` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .
5631	One of -LRB- Jaglom 's -RRB- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love .
5632	Schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does .
5633	A fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
5634	Although Estela Bravo 's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of Cuban leader Fidel Castro , it 's still a guilty pleasure to watch .
5635	Surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it .
5636	The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .
5637	Brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate .
5638	If you can read the subtitles -LRB- the opera is sung in Italian -RRB- and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .
5639	A pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of Crystal and De Niro .
5640	Gangster No. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .
5641	This Chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare .
5642	Has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .
5643	With its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , Bloody Sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in Derry .
5644	You will likely prefer to keep on watching .
5645	Insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion .
5646	But the performances of Pacino , Williams , and Swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .
5647	What might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .
5648	At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .
5649	An Inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds .
5650	This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential
5651	It 's a testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton-Jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .
5652	Performances are potent , and the women 's stories are ably intercut and involving .
5653	An enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .
5654	Lan Yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery .
5655	Your children will be occupied for 72 minutes .
5656	Pull -LRB- s -RRB- off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .
5657	Twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels .
5658	` Tobey Maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
5659	... a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life 's endgame .
5660	Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ...
5661	Road to Perdition does display greatness , and it 's worth seeing .
5662	But it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won .
5663	A marvelous performance by Allison Lohman as an identity-seeking foster child .
5664	Arliss Howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , Big Bad Love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws .
5665	Critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-TV rendition of the notorious MTV show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps .
5666	What a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is .
5667	The charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film 's problems .
5668	A vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior .
5669	A tour de force of modern cinema .
5670	Peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the Dogtown experience .
5671	The lively appeal of The Last Kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy .
5672	Without resorting to camp or parody , Haynes -LRB- like Sirk , but differently -RRB- has transformed the rhetoric of Hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .
5673	The performances are an absolute joy .
5674	A quasi-documentary by French filmmaker Karim Dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of Cuban music .
5675	Grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect .
5676	A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot .
5677	Both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , What Time Is It There ?
5678	may prove to be -LRB- Tsai 's -RRB- masterpiece .
5679	Mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the Yiddish stage .
5680	Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .
5681	It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .
5682	Provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all .
5683	Simplistic , silly and tedious .
5684	It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
5685	Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
5686	-LRB- Garbus -RRB- discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
5687	A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
5688	The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .
5689	About the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time .
5690	Not so much farcical as sour .
5691	Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
5692	All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
5693	A sentimental mess that never rings true .
5694	While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour TV documentary .
5695	Interesting , but not compelling .
5696	On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
5697	While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie 's Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .
5698	There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid
5699	Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This , not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro 's right-hand goombah .
5700	Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of John Pogue , the Yale grad who previously gave us `` The Skulls '' and last year 's `` Rollerball . ''
5701	Enough said , except : Film overboard !
5702	Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .
5703	This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
5704	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .
5705	On its own , it 's not very interesting .
5706	As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
5707	It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
5708	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .
5709	As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .
5710	The party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks .
5711	The rest of the film ... is dudsville .
5712	Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . '
5713	The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
5714	The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
5715	Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
5716	Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .
5717	The action clichÃ©s just pile up .
5718	Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
5719	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
5720	Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .
5721	Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
5722	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
5723	... if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee .
5724	Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary .
5725	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
5726	There 's no getting around the fact that this is Revenge Of The Nerds Revisited -- again .
5727	The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
5728	Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
5729	With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
5730	Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
5731	To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
5732	Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .
5733	The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- achievement does n't match his ambition .
5734	When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! '
5735	An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
5736	Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
5737	PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
5738	Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
5739	An odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
5740	Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
5741	Pascale Bailly 's rom-com provides AmÃ©lie 's Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .
5742	A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
5743	Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
5744	Almost .
5745	... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
5746	The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers .
5747	Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
5748	The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge .
5749	Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .
5750	The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
5751	Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
5752	Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit-Proof Fence find the authority it 's looking for .
5753	Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .
5754	... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer -LRB- and -RRB- the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going .
5755	In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
5756	Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . ''
5757	What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
5758	Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
5759	The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
5760	So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
5761	I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
5762	If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
5763	Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
5764	There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .
5765	`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .
5766	A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .
5767	Takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny .
5768	The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .
5769	Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
5770	Sitting through the last reel -LRB- spoiler alert ! -RRB-
5771	is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .
5772	Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
5773	Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .
5774	With this new Rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
5775	One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
5776	A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
5777	Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .
5778	But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
5779	The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
5780	A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
5781	The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
5782	Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
5783	Feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
5784	Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
5785	Can you bear the laughter ?
5786	Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
5787	There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
5788	Beware the quirky Brit-com .
5789	They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
5790	Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .
5791	The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .
5792	Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
5793	Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .
5794	There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
5795	Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
5796	Adam Sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
5797	There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .
5798	Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .
5799	It 's all pretty tame .
5800	The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
5801	The movie is a mess from start to finish .
5802	The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
5803	I 'm not saying that Ice Age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
5804	In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .
5805	The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichÃ©s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
5806	Terminally brain dead production .
5807	Some episodes work , some do n't .
5808	Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
5809	J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .
5810	Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
5811	Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
5812	Wow .
5813	I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
5814	Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .
5815	It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
5816	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .
5817	It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
5818	Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
5819	The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
5820	The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
5821	There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever .
5822	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
5823	A processed comedy chop suey .
5824	As spent screen series go , Star Trek : Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there 's nothing to drink .
5825	Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
5826	Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .
5827	An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
5828	The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
5829	With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
5830	If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
5831	The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .
5832	Everything is pegged into the groove of a New York dating comedy with ` issues ' to simplify .
5833	A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff .
5834	The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything .
5835	It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
5836	The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
5837	So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .
5838	It never is , not fully .
5839	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
5840	What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
5841	As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
5842	Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
5843	The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
5844	Oozes condescension from every pore .
5845	`` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
5846	The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
5847	Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
5848	It has plenty of laughs .
5849	It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
5850	An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
5851	Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
5852	-LRB- H -RRB- ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang , I 'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by .
5853	Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
5854	it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding
5855	By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
5856	Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
5857	Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
5858	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .
5859	At its worst , it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford .
5860	Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .
5861	This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
5862	With or without ballast tanks , K-19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low .
5863	Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .
5864	You might be shocked to discover that Seinfeld 's real life is boring .
5865	It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
5866	Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .
5867	This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
5868	It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
5869	I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .
5870	One of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .
5871	There 's nothing to gain from watching They .
5872	It is n't scary .
5873	It hates its characters .
5874	It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
5875	Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling , Todd Solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .
5876	The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
5877	... Ice Age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that wo n't win many fans over the age of 12 .
5878	Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
5879	Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
5880	The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
5881	A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
5882	It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .
5883	An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
5884	It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .
5885	Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
5886	Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
5887	If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign .
5888	An EXIT sign , that is .
5889	Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .
5890	The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
5891	A feature-length , R-rated , road-trip version of Mama 's Family .
5892	What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .
5893	Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
5894	Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
5895	There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
5896	Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
5897	The result might look like Vulgar .
5898	Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands .
5899	What soured me on The Santa Clause 2 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .
5900	It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .
5901	The film favors the scientific over the spectacular -LRB- visually speaking -RRB- .
5902	Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
5903	With the exception of McCoist , the players do n't have a clue on the park .
5904	The acting is n't much better .
5905	The whole affair is as predictable as can be .
5906	A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes .
5907	This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .
5908	A suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
5909	Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .
5910	-LRB- N -RRB- o matter how much good will the actors generate , Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .
5911	Every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of Rohypnol .
5912	Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .
5913	Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .
5914	Despite a performance of sustained intelligence from Stanford and another of subtle humour from Bebe Neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces Oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich New York intelligentsia - and its off
5915	Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .
5916	Gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful clichÃ© in the book at this nonsensical story .
5917	A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .
5918	-LRB- P -RRB- artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting .
5919	The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
5920	` You 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied .
5921	You 'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter ... '
5922	Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
5923	Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .
5924	The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn .
5925	The results are far more alienating than involving .
5926	Bogdanich is unashamedly pro-Serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .
5927	A lack of thesis makes Maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .
5928	Without Shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .
5929	If H.G. Wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin 's reworked version , what would he say ?
5930	` It looks good , Sonny , but you missed the point . '
5931	During The Tuxedo 's 90 minutes of screen time , there is n't one true ` Chan moment ' .
5932	Bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie .
5933	Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .
5934	It 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
5935	The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland .
5936	The film can depress you about life itself .
5937	I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clichÃ© .
5938	The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .
5939	Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
5940	The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .
5941	Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
5942	At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
5943	Here 's my advice , Kev .
5944	Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .
5945	An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you 'd be wise to send your regrets .
5946	An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
5947	Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .
5948	Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .
5949	It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .
5950	Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum .
5951	This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
5952	It winds up moving in many directions as it searches -LRB- vainly , I think -RRB- for something fresh to say .
5953	All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .
5954	A big fat pain .
5955	A mimetic approximation of better films like Contempt and 8Â 1\/2 .
5956	Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
5957	Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures .
5958	An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
5959	To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
5960	With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
5961	Mild , meandering teen flick .
5962	Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .
5963	Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before .
5964	Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another Major League .
5965	Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
5966	Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .
5967	One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .
5968	With a tone as variable as the cinematography , Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
5969	To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
5970	Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .
5971	Diane Lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue Adrian Lyne 's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .
5972	Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .
5973	-LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .
5974	This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero .
5975	Silly , loud and goofy .
5976	Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?
5977	The French director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
5978	The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .
5979	The Pool drowned me in boredom .
5980	It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .
5981	It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .
5982	Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
5983	There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
5984	As saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
5985	Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .
5986	As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , Mr. Murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .
5987	The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .
5988	It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this !
5989	This is an interesting movie ! ''
5990	But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
5991	The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
5992	It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .
5993	Avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis ' book .
5994	A poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
5995	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
5996	Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` Saving Private Ryan '' battle scenes before realizing Steven Spielberg got it right the first time ?
5997	It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
5998	... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .
5999	This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .
6000	Why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the TV cow is free ?
6001	There 's no good answer to that one .
6002	This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .
6003	A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .
6004	There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .
6005	This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .
6006	This is amusing for about three minutes .
6007	Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
6008	It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
6009	This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
6010	The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
6011	There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
6012	It wo n't harm anyone , but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it .
6013	After all , it 'll probably be in video stores by Christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
6014	Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
6015	Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .
6016	They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .
6017	Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .
6018	-LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
6019	It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
6020	This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
6021	Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
6022	The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .
6023	The script by Vincent R. Nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
6024	The story is so light and sugary that were it a Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away .
6025	Oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between .
6026	Since Dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche .
6027	Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .
6028	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .
6029	That 's not vintage Spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
6030	Every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be .
6031	Frank McKlusky C.I. is that movie !
6032	It 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .
6033	... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .
6034	The trappings of I Spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun .
6035	What starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film .
6036	In the wake of Saving Private Ryan , Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as Cage 's war-weary marine .
6037	It is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .
6038	Really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length .
6039	Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .
6040	Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .
6041	And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest .
6042	If you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !
6043	Directed without the expected flair or imagination by Hong Kong master John Woo , Windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length .
6044	It 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie .
6045	You could put it on a coffee table anywhere .
6046	The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .
6047	An infuriating film .
6048	Just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .
6049	The entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .
6050	The setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
6051	As an entertainment destination for the general public , Kung Pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .
6052	This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .
6053	As pure over-the-top trash , any John Waters movie has it beat by a country mile .
6054	Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .
6055	Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .
6056	But for the most part , The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
6057	This film biggest problem ?
6058	No laughs .
6059	Less-than-compelling documentary of a Yiddish theater clan .
6060	That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .
6061	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .
6062	It 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental .
6063	I ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ...
6064	Everybody loves a David and Goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from David 's point of view .
6065	Throw Smoochy from the train !
6066	Eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot .
6067	Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
6068	A light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .
6069	Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle .
6070	To paraphrase a line from another Dickens ' novel , Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
6071	The actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers do n't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
6072	The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
6073	An extremely unpleasant film .
6074	A movie just for Friday fans , critics be damned .
6075	If you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .
6076	A sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .
6077	Wait for it to hit cable .
6078	Ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies .
6079	Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives .
6080	77 minutes of Pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does .
6081	My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .
6082	The one not-so-small problem with Expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
6083	A movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .
6084	-LRB- At least -RRB- Moore is a real charmer .
6085	John Carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .
6086	LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
6087	The notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced Prozac Nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
6088	Stale first act , Scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes .
6089	Unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .
6090	A film that loses sight of its own story .
6091	Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash .
6092	The big-screen Scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison .
6093	Few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director Neil Burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering Barry 's terrific performance .
6094	Gets better after Foster leaves that little room .
6095	The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .
6096	Resident Evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV , sugar hysteria , and PlayStation cocktail .
6097	A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .
6098	... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .
6099	Resembles a soft porn Brian De Palma pastiche .
6100	Bluto Blutarsky , we miss you .
6101	Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .
6102	It 's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that .
6103	Woody Allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody .
6104	But I had a lot of problems with this movie .
6105	Devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special .
6106	All movie long , City by the Sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of De Niro , McDormand and the other good actors in the cast .
6107	Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .
6108	However sincere it may be , The Rising Place never quite justifies its own existence .
6109	Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place .
6110	It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .
6111	But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
6112	Paxton 's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre .
6113	The script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair .
6114	The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
6115	The film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work .
6116	Let 's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate .
6117	It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .
6118	Alternately frustrating and rewarding .
6119	It 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure .
6120	Despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , The Man Who Wrote Rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .
6121	Swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit .
6122	Or intelligent .
6123	The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
6124	See Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .
6125	But be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still .
6126	Or that the battery on your watch has died .
6127	Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry British filmmakers have strip-mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .
6128	There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .
6129	Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero .
6130	But fans of the show should not consider this a diss .
6131	Consider it ` perfection . '
6132	The cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing .
6133	Children and adults enamored of all things Pokemon wo n't be disappointed .
6134	I do n't even care that there 's no plot in this Antonio Banderas-Lucy Liu faceoff .
6135	It 's still terrible !
6136	Children of the Century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers .
6137	It 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the National Basketball Association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy Lil ' Bow Wow .
6138	Peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
6139	A close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .
6140	Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -LRB- career - kids = misery -RRB- in tiresome romantic-comedy duds .
6141	The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming .
6142	Just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .
6143	The animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 Ever is any indication .
6144	Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm .
6145	Kids who are into this Thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven .
6146	Anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning .
6147	Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .
6148	Do you say `` hi '' to your lover when you wake up in the morning ?
6149	It makes me feel weird \/ Thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ Like puppies with broken legs \/ And butterflies that die \/ And movies starring pop queens
6150	Director Tom Dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut Shanghai Noon , but Showtime 's uninspired send-up of TV cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .
6151	` Yes , that 's right : it 's Forrest Gump , Angel Of Death . '
6152	A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .
6153	While easier to sit through than most of Jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
6154	About as enjoyable , I would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful .
6155	A generic international version of a typical American horror film .
6156	... while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of Shakespeare 's Macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention .
6157	Lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s .
6158	There 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it .
6159	Absurdities and clichÃ©s accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel .
6160	If you think it 's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy The Hot Chick .
6161	The sheer dumbness of the plot -LRB- other than its one good idea -RRB- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .
6162	Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
6163	The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .
6164	Yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ...
6165	Bond-inspired ?
6166	Certainly .
6167	Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?
6168	Let 's hope not .
6169	This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
6170	Davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
6171	Surprisingly , considering that Baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .
6172	None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .
6173	... a bland murder-on-campus yawner .
6174	A humorless journey into a philosophical void .
6175	These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector .
6176	Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation .
6177	A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .
6178	The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
6179	shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -LRB- but -RRB- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
6180	Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
6181	It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
6182	Clever but not especially compelling .
6183	McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
6184	A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
6185	LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
6186	The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .
6187	The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
6188	Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
6189	What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
6190	Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
6191	Unfortunately , Kapur modernizes A.E.W. Mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young American , a decision that plucks `` The Four Feathers '' bare .
6192	... what a banal bore the preachy Circuit turns out to be
6193	Falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice .
6194	A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences .
6195	One of the most incoherent features in recent memory .
6196	Low rent from frame one .
6197	Eight Legged Freaks ?
6198	No big hairy deal .
6199	The issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -LRB- unintentionally -RRB- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care .
6200	Laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .
6201	The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare .
6202	` This movie sucks . '
6203	None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
6204	A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .
6205	Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .
6206	There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
6207	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
6208	Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
6209	I 've had more interesting -- and , dare I say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
6210	What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .
6211	The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
6212	When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .
6213	There are now two signs that M. Night Shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : Unbreakable and Signs .
6214	... hokey art house pretension .
6215	... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
6216	Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .
6217	Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
6218	This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
6219	A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the Bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .
6220	Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .
6221	The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .
6222	Silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .
6223	There is so much plodding sensitivity .
6224	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
6225	... too sappy for its own good .
6226	Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .
6227	As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
6228	As the Mediterranean sparkles , ` Swept Away ' sinks .
6229	Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .
6230	Half Past Dead is just such an achievement .
6231	Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished .
6232	It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
6233	-LRB- Javier Bardem is -RRB- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
6234	Feels shrill , simple and soapy .
6235	Adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .
6236	Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichÃ©d white-trash situation imaginable .
6237	In the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , The Emperor 's Club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
6238	No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .
6239	A direct-to-void release , heading nowhere .
6240	Typical animÃ© , with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
6241	Below is well below expectations .
6242	At no point during K-19 : The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .
6243	... standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .
6244	Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .
6245	It does n't work as either .
6246	Given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
6247	Possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure .
6248	It falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose .
6249	Jonathan Parker 's Bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films .
6250	There may have been a good film in `` Trouble Every Day , '' but it is not what is on the screen .
6251	Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .
6252	Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
6253	There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
6254	The Master of Disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny .
6255	And for all the wrong reasons besides .
6256	A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .
6257	A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
6258	You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .
6259	The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
6260	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
6261	It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
6262	In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
6263	So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
6264	The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .
6265	If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
6266	Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50 .
6267	Weirdly , Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .
6268	Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
6269	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
6270	A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor Michel Serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .
6271	Boy oh boy , it 's a howler .
6272	A few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks .
6273	The thing just never gets off the ground .
6274	... contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
6275	The actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face .
6276	Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
6277	The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .
6278	However stale the material , Lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
6279	There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
6280	The Tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend David Cross would call it , ` Hungry-Man portions of bad ' .
6281	Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .
6282	The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
6283	While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .
6284	So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
6285	Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
6286	An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
6287	Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .
6288	The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
6289	The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
6290	It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
6291	The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
6292	If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
6293	Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
6294	Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
6295	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .
6296	A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
6297	Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .
6298	A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
6299	Human Nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
6300	A film with a great premise but only a great premise .
6301	Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
6302	Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .
6303	-LRB- Kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB-
6304	A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
6305	What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .
6306	-LRB- Sam 's -RRB- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
6307	An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
6308	Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
6309	The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
6310	This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
6311	Too silly to take seriously .
6312	The inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line .
6313	Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .
6314	I like it .
6315	No , I hate it .
6316	No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .
6317	This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
6318	It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
6319	A fifty car pileup of cliches .
6320	It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
6321	Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
6322	What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
6323	As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .
6324	As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired .
6325	A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
6326	It 's not hateful .
6327	It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
6328	Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
6329	The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
6330	A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
6331	The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
6332	Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .
6333	Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .
6334	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .
6335	A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .
6336	While kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .
6337	Despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from Kathryn Bigelow , The Weight of Water is oppressively heavy .
6338	We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
6339	They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .
6340	They were right .
6341	It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
6342	Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
6343	Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
6344	Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
6345	A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
6346	Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
6347	Too ordinary to restore -LRB- Harmon -RRB- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience .
6348	Stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of Ghost and Close Encounters of the Third Kind .
6349	The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
6350	It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
6351	Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
6352	It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
6353	It still feels like a prison stretch .
6354	Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
6355	Ong chooses to present Ah Na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism .
6356	The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''
6357	Just a Kiss is a just a waste .
6358	... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
6359	Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .
6360	And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .
6361	As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .
6362	A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
6363	This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
6364	It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
6365	There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
6366	The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
6367	As happily glib and vicious as its characters .
6368	One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
6369	No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .
6370	-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
6371	I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
6372	Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
6373	Kurys never shows why , of all the period 's volatile romantic lives , Sand and Musset are worth particular attention .
6374	Almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited .
6375	And in a sense , that 's a liability .
6376	It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
6377	If you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .
6378	The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
6379	Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .
6380	If I want music , I 'll buy the soundtrack .
6381	If I want a real movie , I 'll buy the Criterion DVD .
6382	An unremarkable , modern action\/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title .
6383	Has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together .
6384	Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . '
6385	Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
6386	The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
6387	An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
6388	The name says it all .
6389	Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .
6390	Children , Christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of Jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , Catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .
6391	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
6392	... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
6393	With Zoe Clarke-Williams 's lackluster thriller `` New Best Friend '' , who needs enemies ?
6394	Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
6395	Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
6396	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
6397	aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` Comedian '
6398	A perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
6399	The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .
6400	The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
6401	The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
6402	Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
6403	As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .
6404	I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
6405	There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .
6406	The Emperor 's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ...
6407	In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . '
6408	A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
6409	Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
6410	The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
6411	Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?
6412	Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
6413	Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
6414	Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
6415	A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog .
6416	The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland JoffÃ© and Demi Moore 's The Scarlet Letter .
6417	The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .
6418	As a movie , it never seems fresh and vital .
6419	It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
6420	It labours as storytelling .
6421	The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .
6422	A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .
6423	Lawrence should stick to his day job .
6424	He 's a better actor than a standup comedian .
6425	Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
6426	A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .
6427	I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
6428	A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .
6429	Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
6430	We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
6431	The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
6432	Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .
6433	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
6434	Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .
6435	At best , Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .
6436	Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
6437	Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
6438	As plain and pedestrian as catsup --
6439	An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it .
6440	I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .
6441	Your stomach for Heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn .
6442	A picture as erratic as its central character .
6443	Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .
6444	It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
6445	The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
6446	Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets .
6447	Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
6448	Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .
6449	Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
6450	All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .
6451	Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .
6452	The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
6453	For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .
6454	This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .
6455	A bit too eager to please .
6456	You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous -LRB- than Leon -RRB- .
6457	Kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself .
6458	`` the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store ''
6459	Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .
6460	One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .
6461	` The ChÃ¢teau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
6462	Meyjes focuses too much on Max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the - making .
6463	Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
6464	Crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .
6465	There is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film Oscar : Make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .
6466	Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore .
6467	An incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .
6468	The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
6469	All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director George Hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .
6470	The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
6471	the phone rings and a voice tells you you 've got seven days left to live .
6472	Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .
6473	O.K. , not really .
6474	Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .
6475	The film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling .
6476	... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
6477	Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
6478	Befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
6479	From beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film .
6480	The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
6481	It 's just not very smart .
6482	Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
6483	Imagine -LRB- if possible -RRB- a Pasolini film without passion or politics , or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching O Fantasma .
6484	In trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .
6485	90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
6486	Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
6487	Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
6488	After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .
6489	This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .
6490	It 's drab .
6491	It 's uninteresting .
6492	It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !
6493	The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .
6494	This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .
6495	A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .
6496	Forget the Psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore .
6497	A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .
6498	It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
6499	New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .
6500	Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
6501	When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .
6502	I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .
6503	The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
6504	An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .
6505	Only for young children , if them .
6506	Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
6507	For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .
6508	No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .
6509	A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer .
6510	The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .
6511	Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''
6512	Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
6513	Hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .
6514	Howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a BuÃ±uel retrospective .
6515	The best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments .
6516	It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
6517	An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .
6518	If only there were one for this kind of movie .
6519	By the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived .
6520	The heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in -LRB- this -RRB- meandering and pointless French coming-of-age import from writer-director Anne-Sophie Birot .
6521	A peculiar misfire that even Tunney ca n't save .
6522	Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
6523	I ca n't remember the last time I saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in Extreme Ops .
6524	Too much of Nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
6525	I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .
6526	When Mr. Hundert tells us in his narration that ` this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement .
6527	Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .
6528	It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .
6529	Each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
6530	A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .
6531	Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .
6532	The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .
6533	works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
6534	Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .
6535	4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .
6536	Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
6537	Trailer park Magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .
6538	Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
6539	... its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits .
6540	Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .
6541	The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
6542	I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat .
6543	I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
6544	The filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .
6545	The film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .
6546	... the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation .
6547	There 's already been too many of these films ...
6548	Several of Steven Soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist .
6549	Sadly , Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .
6550	Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
6551	Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .
6552	` The War of the Roses , ' trailer-trash style .
6553	Entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel .
6554	Supposedly , Pokemon ca n't be killed , but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .
6555	White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .
6556	When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?
6557	Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , The Full Monty , with something different .
6558	The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
6559	This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .
6560	Hmmm ... might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?
6561	The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
6562	Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
6563	How this one escaped the Lifetime network I 'll never know .
6564	Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?
6565	One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
6566	For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
6567	I have to admit that I am baffled by Jason X.
6568	A mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
6569	Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos .
6570	This is a film living far too much in its own head .
6571	The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .
6572	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House , but it more closely resembles this year 's version of Tomcats .
6573	The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .
6574	Dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .
6575	A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls .
6576	More of a career curio than a major work .
6577	It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .
6578	Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .
6579	To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for God 's sake !
6580	-- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw .
6581	As we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- Jason is a killer who does n't know the meaning of the word ` quit . '
6582	The filmmakers might want to look it up .
6583	A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .
6584	What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
6585	Drowning 's too good for this sucker .
6586	An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .
6587	Frankly , it 's pretty stupid .
6588	I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever .
6589	But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...
6590	Love Liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .
6591	There are things to like about Murder By Numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do n't gel .
6592	... tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry .
6593	Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
6594	My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...
6595	The innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be .
6596	Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .
6597	Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .
6598	Should have gone straight to video .
6599	It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
6600	It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .
6601	Consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director I admire .
6602	A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-Century crime as a metaphor for -- well , I 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
6603	Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .
6604	Heavy with flabby rolls of typical Toback machinations .
6605	It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
6606	Snow Dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
6607	Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
6608	Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
6609	Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would .
6610	The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .
6611	Charlize CHASES Kevin with a GUN .
6612	Courtney CHASES Stuart with a CELL PHONE .
6613	The sound of GUNFIRE and cell phones RINGING .
6614	If The Tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .
6615	Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .
6616	... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that I ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .
6617	Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that Seagal 's overweight and out of shape .
6618	A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit .
6619	Impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act .
6620	Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .
6621	While the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other .
6622	Britney Spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .
6623	Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
6624	Consider this review life-affirming .
6625	If the movie were all comedy , it might work better .
6626	But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .
6627	The movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it .
6628	Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
6629	Big time .
6630	This heist flick about young Brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel , Seth Green and Barry Pepper .
6631	It should have stayed there .
6632	The film has a childlike quality about it .
6633	But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
6634	The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
6635	It 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .
6636	Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level .
6637	The movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .
6638	The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers .
6639	Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
6640	There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but Brooms is n't it .
6641	The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
6642	Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans .
6643	But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
6644	Too clever by about nine-tenths .
6645	Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .
6646	Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
6647	Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .
6648	Director Carl Franklin , so crisp and economical in One False Move , bogs down in genre cliches here .
6649	Mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame .
6650	Like the Hanks character , he 's a slow study : The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .
6651	This thing is just garbage .
6652	As crimes go , writer-director Michael Kalesniko 's How to Kill Your Neighbor 's Dog is slight but unendurable .
6653	There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
6654	A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .
6655	An uplifting , largely bogus story .
6656	An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
6657	If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .
6658	My own minority report is that it stinks .
6659	Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
6660	The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .
6661	... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
6662	While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
6663	With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
6664	-LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
6665	Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .
6666	... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
6667	Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
6668	A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .
6669	waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .
6670	Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .
6671	Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .
6672	The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
6673	It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
6674	I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .
6675	Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
6676	meanders between its powerful moments .
6677	What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
6678	A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
6679	Pure of intention and passably diverting , His Secret Life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .
6680	... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story .
6681	Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
6682	It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
6683	Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
6684	A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .
6685	To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
6686	-LRB- T -RRB- oo many of these gross out scenes ...
6687	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
6688	Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .
6689	Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .
6690	If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism
6691	One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
6692	The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .
6693	It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .
6694	Charming , if overly complicated ...
6695	Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .
6696	All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .
6697	It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
6698	Hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't .
6699	Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
6700	For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .
6701	Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .
6702	Smothered by its own solemnity .
6703	` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
6704	Might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .
6705	After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .
6706	Not one moment in the enterprise did n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .
6707	In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .
6708	The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
6709	Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
6710	There 's no question that Epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .
6711	If only Merchant paid more attention the story .
6712	At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
6713	... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
6714	A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
6715	The characters are based on stock clichÃ©s , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
6716	Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .
6717	Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .
6718	A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
6719	Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
6720	The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
6721	Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .
6722	plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
6723	The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
6724	For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .
6725	I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .
6726	Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''
6727	Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway
6728	Naipaul fans may be disappointed .
6729	Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .
6730	Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
6731	If you 're a Crocodile Hunter fan , you 'll enjoy at least the `` real '' portions of the film .
6732	If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother .
6733	Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
6734	By that measure , it is a failure .
6735	A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .
6736	An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .
6737	Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .
6738	Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .
6739	The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .
6740	Has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
6741	An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .
6742	The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
6743	Everyone 's to blame here .
6744	You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
6745	Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
6746	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
6747	It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
6748	A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .
6749	Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness .
6750	But what is missing from it all is a moral .
6751	What is the filmmakers ' point ?
6752	Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
6753	You see Robin Williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm .
6754	You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
6755	Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .
6756	The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
6757	Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
6758	Draggin ' about dragons
6759	Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .
6760	A respectable but uninspired thriller that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .
6761	Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .
6762	The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .
6763	Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
6764	Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen .
6765	`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
6766	You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .
6767	Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
6768	Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
6769	First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
6770	... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
6771	Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
6772	Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
6773	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
6774	Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .
6775	Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .
6776	The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
6777	Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .
6778	But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
6779	In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .
6780	This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
6781	The film is flat .
6782	The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .
6783	It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
6784	An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
6785	The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
6786	Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?
6787	This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
6788	The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
6789	When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .
6790	It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
6791	The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
6792	Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
6793	Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .
6794	An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
6795	Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
6796	This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
6797	It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
6798	Oh , and Booty Call .
6799	Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
6800	It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
6801	Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
6802	Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .
6803	A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
6804	The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
6805	A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
6806	At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
6807	Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
6808	Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .
6809	What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
6810	Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...
6811	An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
6812	Not once does it come close to being exciting .
6813	A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby performs neither one very well .
6814	It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
6815	There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
6816	And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser .
6817	One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
6818	Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .
6819	The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
6820	It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
6821	I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
6822	Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
6823	So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .
6824	The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
6825	Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .
6826	It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
6827	Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .
6828	A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
6829	For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer .
6830	If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .
6831	Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
6832	Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
6833	Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
6834	This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
6835	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
6836	A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
6837	A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
6838	Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
6839	We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
6840	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
6841	Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
6842	A fascinating but choppy documentary .
6843	Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
6844	The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .
6845	And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
6846	Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
6847	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
6848	The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
6849	Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
6850	Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .
6851	... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
6852	Never comes together as a coherent whole .
6853	An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
6854	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
6855	And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
6856	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
6857	There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
6858	This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
6859	Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
6860	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
6861	The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
6862	A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
6863	An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
6864	Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .
6865	Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .
6866	The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
6867	Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
6868	A film that suffers because of its many excesses .
6869	Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
6870	In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
6871	But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
6872	Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
6873	Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .
6874	` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
6875	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
6876	... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
6877	Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
6878	It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
6879	This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
6880	MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
6881	That 's because relatively nothing happens .
6882	No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
6883	Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
6884	Boyd 's screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
6885	There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
6886	Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
6887	A moving picture that does not move .
6888	Ruh-roh !
6889	Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !
6890	Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
6891	I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
6892	` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
6893	... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
6894	Is it a comedy ?
6895	A drama ?
6896	A romance ?
6897	A cartoon ?
6898	Ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing .
6899	Did the film inform and educate me ?
6900	Yes .
6901	Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?
6902	No. .
6903	And that is where Ararat went astray .
6904	It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
6905	Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
6906	Eight Legged Freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster\/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ...
6907	It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
6908	Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
6909	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
6910	A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
6911	Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
6912	Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
6913	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
6914	The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
6915	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
6916	This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .
6917	A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
6918	This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
6919	Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .
6920	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
6921	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
6922	The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''
6923	It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
6924	The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
6925	Worthy of the gong .
6926	While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .
6927	I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
6928	The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
6929	The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .
6930	As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
6931	Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
6932	Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
6933	It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
6934	Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
6935	Oops , she 's really done it this time .
6936	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
6937	It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
6938	A chiller resolutely without chills .
6939	For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .
6940	The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
6941	`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
6942	Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
6943	Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
6944	The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
6945	The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight .
6946	Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
6947	It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
6948	Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
6949	If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
6950	Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichÃ©s that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .
6951	The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
6952	... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
6953	I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story .
6954	This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
6955	Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
6956	Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
6957	None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
6958	As social exposÃ© , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on .
6959	The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
6960	There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
6961	The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
6962	This one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived .
6963	Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
6964	Bad and baffling from the get-go .
6965	A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
6966	At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
6967	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .
6968	A well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .
6969	Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
6970	You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
6971	There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
6972	Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
6973	But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
6974	It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
6975	Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
6976	Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
6977	Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken
6978	Was I scared ?
6979	Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .
6980	Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?
6981	A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
6982	By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
6983	Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !
6984	True Hollywood Story .
6985	Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '
6986	Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology .
6987	But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
6988	It 's one long bore .
6989	It gets old quickly .
6990	Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .
6991	It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .
6992	... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .
6993	Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .
6994	The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
6995	It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
6996	We just do n't really care too much about this love story .
6997	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
6998	The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
6999	Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...
7000	` Men in Black II creates a new threat for the MIB , but recycles the same premise .
7001	Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .
7002	But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .
7003	Feels familiar and tired .
7004	A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .
7005	Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
7006	Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .
7007	A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
7008	A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
7009	It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
7010	Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
7011	Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
7012	An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .
7013	Horrible .
7014	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
7015	Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .
7016	An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
7017	Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
7018	As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -LRB- Franco -RRB- has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
7019	The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
7020	It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
7021	` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .
7022	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
7023	Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
7024	Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
7025	The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .
7026	This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
7027	... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .
7028	Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .
7029	A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .
7030	It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
7031	... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
7032	ending .
7033	This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .
7034	Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
7035	It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
7036	So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .
7037	Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
7038	It 's Splash without the jokes .
7039	The ChÃ¢teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .
7040	Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
7041	Shallow , noisy and pretentious .
7042	Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
7043	Granddad of Le Nouvelle Vague , Jean-Luc Godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .
7044	This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .
7045	It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
7046	But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .
7047	Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
7048	A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .
7049	Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
7050	Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .
7051	Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
7052	A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .
7053	I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .
7054	Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .
7055	Two hours of junk .
7056	Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and Joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr .
7057	Self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable .
7058	A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .
7059	The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -LRB- it -RRB- comes off like a Hallmark commercial .
7060	What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .
7061	The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .
7062	... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...
7063	The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
7064	Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
7065	I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
7066	It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
7067	This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
7068	Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .
7069	But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
7070	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
7071	A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
7072	Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
7073	It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
7074	The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
7075	The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
7076	An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .
7077	Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
7078	Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .
7079	`` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .
7080	Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .
7081	Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
7082	Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
7083	Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .
7084	Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
7085	The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
7086	Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .
7087	Generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style .
7088	With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
7089	It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
7090	Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?
7091	Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .
7092	The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .
7093	Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .
7094	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
7095	In the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .
7096	For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
7097	While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .
7098	Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
7099	Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .
7100	As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
7101	Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .
7102	With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .
7103	He fails .
7104	I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
7105	A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .
7106	Goes on and on to the point of nausea .
7107	By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
7108	Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
7109	One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
7110	The comedy is nonexistent .
7111	... a bland , pretentious mess .
7112	It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .
7113	A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
7114	It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
7115	If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away .
7116	Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .
7117	This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
7118	The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .
7119	Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
7120	It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
7121	Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .
7122	Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .
7123	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
7124	The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
7125	One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .
7126	Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
7127	The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .
7128	This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .
7129	The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
7130	Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .
7131	... will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks .
7132	After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
7133	Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
7134	As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .
7135	But , for that , why not watch a documentary ?
7136	With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .
7137	Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .
7138	Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
7139	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
7140	Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .
7141	It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
7142	The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .
7143	One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .
7144	... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster .
7145	The corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .
7146	As violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen .
7147	Egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
7148	Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
7149	This is a truly , truly bad movie .
7150	Despite bearing the Paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement European pickup .
7151	What 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up .
7152	Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
7153	Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .
7154	Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they 'd need a shower .
7155	The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .
7156	His best film remains his shortest , The Hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .
7157	Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
7158	... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .
7159	Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .
7160	Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
7161	Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .
7162	Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ?
7163	-- but certainly hard to hate .
7164	A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
7165	It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .
7166	- greaseballs mob action-comedy .
7167	Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .
7168	The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
7169	The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
7170	Ca n't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ?
7171	Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .
7172	In The New Guy , even the bull gets recycled .
7173	Largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .
7174	On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .
7175	This is the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong 's John Woo .
7176	He 's not good with people .
7177	Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
7178	-LRB- Stevens is -RRB- so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
7179	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
7180	One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
7181	Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .
7182	He has a great cast and a great idea .
7183	But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .
7184	... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .
7185	It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
7186	When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
7187	An overstylized , purÃ©ed mÃ©lange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy .
7188	Sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .
7189	` Lovely and Amazing , ' unhappily , is neither ... excessively strained and contrived .
7190	Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .
7191	Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .
7192	This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .
7193	` It 's painful to watch Witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination , I mean , Alabama . '
7194	A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
7195	Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .
7196	Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .
7197	Amidst the action , the script carries Arnold -LRB- and the viewers -RRB- into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''
7198	Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .
7199	It 's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by Elizabeth Hurley in a bathing suit .
7200	... one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .
7201	Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .
7202	Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
7203	Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters .
7204	Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .
7205	The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
7206	A clichÃ©d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men .
7207	The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
7208	A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .
7209	While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire .
7210	The script boasts some tart TV-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .
7211	Despite the pyrotechnics , Narc is strictly by the book .
7212	In both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
7213	You end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .
7214	Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .
7215	Worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades .
7216	The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
7217	One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .
7218	Gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it .
7219	Your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make .
7220	Includes too much obvious padding .
7221	There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .
7222	I 'm not sure which half of Dragonfly is worse : The part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid .
7223	Do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .
7224	The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .
7225	Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...
7226	Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .
7227	Conforms itself with creating a game of ` who 's who ' ... where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .
7228	Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .
7229	The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
7230	Suffers from all the excesses of the genre .
7231	The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
7232	The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
7233	Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .
7234	While the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
7235	They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
7236	It 's harmless , diverting fluff .
7237	But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
7238	It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
7239	Comedy troupe Broken Lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot .
7240	Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick .
7241	A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
7242	It 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .
7243	` All in all , Reign of Fire will be a good -LRB- successful -RRB- rental . '
7244	Occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .
7245	A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .
7246	The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
7247	Who are ` they ' ?
7248	Well , they 're ` they ' .
7249	They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .
7250	They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''
7251	, `` They 're out there ! ''
7252	and `` They 're coming ! ''
7253	Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .
7254	Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '
7255	The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
7256	I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .
7257	It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
7258	The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
7259	Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .
7260	Clare Peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little American Pie-like irreverence .
7261	Video games are more involving than this mess .
7262	Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer .
7263	A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .
7264	... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .
7265	Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .
7266	A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .
7267	The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .
7268	Essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .
7269	A mess .
7270	The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
7271	The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
7272	Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
7273	Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .
7274	Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
7275	In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .
7276	You can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer .
7277	Thumbs down .
7278	The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects .
7279	... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .
7280	The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
7281	The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '
7282	but ` Why ? '
7283	Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .
7284	A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .
7285	A movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . '
7286	Occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .
7287	If we 're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she 's French , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?
7288	Moretti plays Giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy .
7289	Too predictably , in fact .
7290	Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors .
7291	This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
7292	It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
7293	Arnie blows things up .
7294	Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?
7295	An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
7296	... they missed the boat .
7297	More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
7298	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
7299	The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
7300	Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .
7301	Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority .
7302	Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
7303	It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
7304	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
7305	Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
7306	A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .
7307	The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .
7308	Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .
7309	What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
7310	If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Was n't , Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor .
7311	A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
7312	Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .
7313	Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
7314	Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
7315	Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe .
7316	Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .
7317	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
7318	Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me -LRB- horrors ! -RRB-
7319	into Scrooge .
7320	Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
7321	Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
7322	is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
7323	May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
7324	There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
7325	Where 's the movie here ?
7326	A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .
7327	Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
7328	Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .
7329	Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichÃ©s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .
7330	Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
7331	It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
7332	Without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a Kieslowski morality tale , MaelstrÃ¶m is just another Winter Sleepers .
7333	Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .
7334	` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .
7335	If there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam .
7336	The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .
7337	-LRB- E -RRB- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .
7338	I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .
7339	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .
7340	Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .
7341	In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .
7342	Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .
7343	It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .
7344	His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .
7345	Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .
7346	At times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .
7347	They should have called it Gutterball .
7348	Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .
7349	Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .
7350	It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
7351	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .
7352	Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
7353	Slick piece of cross-promotion .
7354	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .
7355	It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
7356	It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
7357	Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi 's generic angst -LRB- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -RRB- .
7358	-LRB- T -RRB- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
7359	It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .
7360	The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
7361	I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
7362	Apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other .
7363	Too much of the humor falls flat .
7364	Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
7365	Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
7366	The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
7367	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .
7368	The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous -LRB- but with bears , and a G rating -RRB- , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
7369	No way I can believe this load of junk .
7370	`` Roger Michell -LRB- '' Notting Hill `` -RRB- directs a morality thriller . ''
7371	It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
7372	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
7373	Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
7374	The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
7375	But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
7376	Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .
7377	And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .
7378	There 's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichÃ©d , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club .
7379	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
7380	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
7381	The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
7382	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
7383	It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
7384	This movie is maddening .
7385	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
7386	Should have been someone else -
7387	The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
7388	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
7389	Would n't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
7390	The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .
7391	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
7392	... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .
7393	I had to look away - this was god awful .
7394	Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .
7395	Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
7396	Just one bad idea after another .
7397	Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
7398	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
7399	A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
7400	Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
7401	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
7402	It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
7403	A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .
7404	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
7405	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
7406	It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
7407	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
7408	Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
7409	An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .
7410	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
7411	Hey Arnold !
7412	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
7413	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
7414	Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
7415	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
7416	A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
7417	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
7418	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
7419	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
7420	We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !
7421	Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
7422	The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .
7423	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
7424	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
7425	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
7426	Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
7427	Try as I may , I ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '
7428	when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
7429	While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
7430	It treats women like idiots .
7431	Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
7432	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
7433	A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .
7434	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
7435	For starters , the story is just too slim .
7436	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
7437	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
7438	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
7439	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
7440	Almost gags on its own gore .
7441	How do you spell clichÃ© ?
7442	It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
7443	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
7444	While -LRB- Hill -RRB- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
7445	In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a rÃ©sumÃ© loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''
7446	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
7447	Under 15 ?
7448	A giggle a minute .
7449	Over age 15 ?
7450	Big Fat Waste of Time .
7451	Hey Arnold !
7452	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
7453	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
7454	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
7455	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
7456	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
7457	Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .
7458	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
7459	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .
7460	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
7461	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
7462	Yes , Ballistic is silly .
7463	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
7464	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
7465	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
7466	While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
7467	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
7468	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
7469	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
7470	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .
7471	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
7472	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence
7473	A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
7474	Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
7475	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
7476	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
7477	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
7478	Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
7479	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
7480	It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
7481	Holden Caulfield did it better .
7482	A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
7483	Oh come on .
7484	Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
7485	If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
7486	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
7487	Not exactly the Bees Knees
7488	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
7489	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
7490	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
7491	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
7492	Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
7493	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
7494	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
7495	It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
7496	This is nothing but familiar territory .
7497	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
7498	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
7499	A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
7500	Too slow , too long and too little happens .
7501	The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
7502	It 's just filler .
7503	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
7504	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
7505	A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .
7506	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
7507	It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
7508	They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
7509	Barely gets off the ground .
7510	Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .
7511	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
7512	At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s .
7513	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
7514	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
7515	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
7516	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
7517	Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .
7518	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .
7519	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
7520	Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
7521	Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
7522	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
7523	Do not see this film .
7524	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
7525	Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .
7526	If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
7527	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
7528	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
7529	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
7530	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
7531	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
7532	It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .
7533	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
7534	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
7535	To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
7536	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
7537	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
7538	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
7539	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
7540	... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
7541	It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
7542	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
7543	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
7544	A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
7545	Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
7546	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
7547	What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
7548	All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
7549	A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .
7550	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
7551	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
7552	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
7553	For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
7554	A coarse and stupid gross-out .
7555	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
7556	Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
7557	There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
7558	It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
7559	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
7560	But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
7561	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
7562	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
7563	Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .
7564	That 's a cheat .
7565	Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
7566	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
7567	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
7568	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
7569	Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars .
7570	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
7571	An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .
7572	It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
7573	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
7574	It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
7575	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
7576	A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .
7577	It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
7578	columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
7579	The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .
7580	I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .
7581	It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
7582	Socrates motions for hemlock .
7583	The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work .
7584	Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
7585	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
7586	It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
7587	Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .
7588	I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
7589	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
7590	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
7591	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
7592	I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
7593	... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .
7594	I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
7595	After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
7596	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
7597	Its well of thorn and vinegar -LRB- and simple humanity -RRB- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
7598	For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
7599	Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .
7600	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
7601	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
7602	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .
7603	A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .
7604	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
7605	There can be no other explanation .
7606	Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
7607	Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
7608	-LRB- A -RRB- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
7609	Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
7610	Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
7611	a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
7612	A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
7613	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
7614	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
7615	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
7616	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
7617	It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
7618	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
7619	-LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
7620	The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .
7621	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
7622	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
7623	Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
7624	There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
7625	It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
7626	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
7627	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
7628	More maudlin than sharp .
7629	This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
7630	It 's slow -- very , very slow .
7631	It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
7632	That 's pure PR hype .
7633	Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .
7634	Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
7635	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
7636	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
7637	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
7638	If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .
7639	I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
7640	And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
7641	It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
7642	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
7643	... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
7644	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
7645	My reaction in a word : disappointment .
7646	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
7647	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
7648	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
7649	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
7650	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
7651	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
7652	In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis BuÃ±uel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
7653	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
7654	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
7655	A workshop mentality prevails .
7656	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
7657	Yes , dull .
7658	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
7659	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
7660	-LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
7661	Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
7662	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
7663	An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
7664	A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...
7665	It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
7666	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
7667	New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
7668	an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
7669	If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
7670	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
7671	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
7672	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
7673	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
7674	This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .
7675	This is her Blue Lagoon .
7676	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
7677	... the film suffers from a lack of humor -LRB- something needed to balance out the violence -RRB- ...
7678	Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
7679	An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
7680	Has all the depth of a wading pool .
7681	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
7682	The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .
7683	... the movie is just a plain old monster .
7684	If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
7685	One long string of cliches .
7686	Fancy a real downer ?
7687	-LRB- Leigh -RRB- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
7688	Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
7689	Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
7690	Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
7691	But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
7692	At once half-baked and overheated .
7693	There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
7694	I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
7695	-LRB- Serry -RRB- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
7696	It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
7697	By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .
7698	Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .
7699	The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
7700	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
7701	Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
7702	Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
7703	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
7704	I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
7705	A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .
7706	... think of it as American Pie On Valium .
7707	Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
7708	Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
7709	... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
7710	It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
7711	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
7712	Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/
7713	Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .
7714	For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
7715	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
7716	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
7717	Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
7718	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
7719	It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
7720	As vulgar as it is banal .
7721	You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
7722	The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
7723	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
7724	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
7725	Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .
7726	Both deserve better .
7727	Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
7728	Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
7729	A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
7730	Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
7731	A sometimes tedious film .
7732	Teen movies have really hit the skids .
7733	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
7734	... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
7735	Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
7736	What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
7737	does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
7738	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
7739	just not campy enough
7740	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
7741	It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
7742	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
7743	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
7744	For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
7745	American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian-American would recognize .
7746	And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
7747	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
7748	Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
7749	... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
7750	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
7751	Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .
7752	Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .
7753	It 's a buggy drag .
7754	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
7755	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
7756	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
7757	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
7758	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
7759	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
7760	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
7761	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
7762	Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
7763	... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .
7764	Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
7765	I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .
7766	There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
7767	The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
7768	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
7769	A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work .
7770	A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
7771	Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
7772	... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
7773	Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
7774	This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
7775	While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
7776	It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
7777	Let 's hope -- shall we ?
7778	-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
7779	Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
7780	I do n't think so .
7781	Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
7782	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
7783	If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
7784	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
7785	Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
7786	But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
7787	Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
7788	It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
7789	Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
7790	Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
7791	The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
7792	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
7793	A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
7794	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
7795	To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
7796	At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .
7797	The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
7798	As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
7799	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
7800	There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
7801	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
7802	It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
7803	Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
7804	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
7805	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
7806	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
7807	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
7808	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
7809	Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
7810	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
7811	Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
7812	It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
7813	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
7814	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
7815	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
7816	I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
7817	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
7818	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
7819	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
7820	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
7821	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
7822	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
7823	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
7824	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
7825	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
7826	Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .
7827	It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
7828	Bad .
7829	Very bad .
7830	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
7831	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
7832	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
7833	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
7834	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
7835	Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
7836	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
7837	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
7838	Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
7839	Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
7840	But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
7841	Long Time Dead ?
7842	Not nearly long enough .
7843	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
7844	A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
7845	There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
7846	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
7847	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
7848	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
7849	McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
7850	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .
7851	Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
7852	Who needs love like this ?
7853	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
7854	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
7855	Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
7856	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
7857	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
7858	It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
7859	Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
7860	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
7861	A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
7862	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
7863	I 'm just too bored to care .
7864	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
7865	Not a stereotype is omitted nor a clichÃ© left unsaid .
7866	As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .
7867	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
7868	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
7869	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
7870	Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
7871	A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
7872	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
7873	This is so bad .
7874	Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .
7875	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
7876	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
7877	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
7878	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
7879	It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
7880	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
7881	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
7882	At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
7883	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
7884	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
7885	The end result is a film that 's neither .
7886	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
7887	Something like scrubbing the toilet .
7888	Or emptying rat traps .
7889	Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
7890	Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
7891	\/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
7892	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
7893	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
7894	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
7895	The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
7896	But it could have been worse .
7897	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
7898	Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
7899	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
7900	... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
7901	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
7902	It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
7903	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
7904	Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
7905	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
7906	Demands too much of most viewers .
7907	The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -LRB- and torturing -RRB- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
7908	It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
7909	So I just did .
7910	Shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
7911	The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear .
7912	The film seems a dead weight .
7913	The lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
7914	For anyone who grew up on Disney 's 1950 Treasure Island , or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
7915	A clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff .
7916	Watching Scarlet Diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both .
7917	Instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .
7918	Meandering , sub-aquatic mess : It 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
7919	The ending is a cop-out .
7920	What happens to John Q ?
7921	I do n't have an I Am Sam clue .
7922	Has the feel of an unedited personal journal .
7923	Remember when Bond had more glamour than clamor ?
7924	No more .
7925	Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .
7926	This charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make Jay and Silent Bob 's Excellent Adventure seem understated .
7927	It does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` Confessions of a Dangerous Mind . ''
7928	The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
7929	... Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .
7930	Unlike his directorial efforts , La Femme Nikita and The Professional , The Transporter lacks Besson 's perspective as a storyteller .
7931	The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
7932	Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots .
7933	This one 's weaker than most .
7934	Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones .
7935	The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
7936	You can practically smell the patchouli oil .
7937	To say Analyze That is De Niro 's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
7938	The actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
7939	An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
7940	This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
7941	Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
7942	Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
7943	Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
7944	There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
7945	The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
7946	When -LRB- De Palma 's -RRB- bad , he 's really bad , and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
7947	Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .
7948	I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .
7949	Uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things .
7950	All 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .
7951	The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
7952	If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .
7953	Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
7954	It 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
7955	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
7956	In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
7957	... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
7958	A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
7959	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
7960	Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
7961	Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
7962	A one-trick pony whose few T&A bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .
7963	The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
7964	It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
7965	The production values are up there .
7966	The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
7967	The voices are fine as well .
7968	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
7969	It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
7970	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
7971	Well , it does go on forever .
7972	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
7973	Topkapi this is not .
7974	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
7975	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
7976	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
7977	I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
7978	While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
7979	If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
7980	A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
7981	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
7982	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
7983	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
7984	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
7985	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
7986	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
7987	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
7988	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
7989	But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
7990	An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
7991	It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
7992	A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
7993	Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
7994	It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
7995	This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
7996	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
7997	It 's a trifle .
7998	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
7999	Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
8000	Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .
8001	After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
8002	Too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss .
8003	Chao was Chen Kaige 's assistant for years in China .
8004	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
8005	A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
8006	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
8007	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
8008	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
8009	If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
8010	So what is the point ?
8011	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
8012	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
8013	When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
8014	When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
8015	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
8016	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
8017	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
8018	You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes .
8019	Choose your reaction : A. -RRB- That sure is funny !
8020	B. -RRB- That sure is pathetic !
8021	A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
8022	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .
8023	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
8024	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
8025	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
8026	But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
8027	A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
8028	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
8029	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
8030	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
8031	A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
8032	The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
8033	What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .
8034	... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .
8035	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
8036	It 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in French -LRB- well , mostly -RRB- with English subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
8037	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
8038	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
8039	Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichÃ©s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
8040	It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
8041	It 's laughing at us .
8042	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
8043	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
8044	For Benigni it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
8045	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
8046	Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
8047	Both awful and appealing .
8048	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
8049	Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
8050	We are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
8051	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
8052	It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
8053	I hated every minute of it .
8054	-LRB- T -RRB- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the Stepford Wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
8055	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
8056	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
8057	There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
8058	A simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
8059	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
8060	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
8061	Anthony Hopkins ?
8062	Big deal !
8063	We 've already seen the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
8064	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
8065	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
8066	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
8067	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
8068	It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
8069	It 's just incredibly dull .
8070	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
8071	A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
8072	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
8073	But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
8074	Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
8075	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
8076	Despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -LRB- Seinfeld 's -RRB- revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .
8077	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
8078	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
8079	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
8080	The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
8081	I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
8082	I wonder why .
8083	They felt like the same movie to me .
8084	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America 's Sweetheart .
8085	An ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
8086	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
8087	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .
8088	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
8089	That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
8090	A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
8091	If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''
8092	or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
8093	It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -LRB- and an uneasy alliance , at that -RRB- .
8094	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
8095	You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
8096	You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
8097	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
8098	Ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
8099	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
8100	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
8101	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
8102	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
8103	For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
8104	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
8105	Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .
8106	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
8107	The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
8108	The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
8109	IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .
8110	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
8111	focuses on Joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
8112	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
8113	A bit of an unwieldy mess .
8114	With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
8115	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
8116	The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
8117	A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
8118	... the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs .
8119	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
8120	... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
8121	It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
8122	It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
8123	Largely a for-fans artifact .
8124	There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
8125	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
8126	There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
8127	-LRB- I -RRB- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .
8128	First-time director JoÃ£o Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
8129	No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
8130	A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
8131	A boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
8132	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
8133	When the first few villians are introduced as `` Spider '' and `` Snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
8134	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
8135	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
8136	-LRB- Director -RRB- Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .
8137	So few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
8138	It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
8139	Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
8140	It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
8141	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
8142	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
8143	That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .
8144	I did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
8145	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
8146	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
8147	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
8148	Immediately .
8149	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
8150	-LRB- It 's -RRB- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
8151	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
8152	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
8153	... -LRB- a -RRB- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
8154	A sour , nasty offering .
8155	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
8156	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
8157	It tells more than it shows .
8158	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
8159	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
8160	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
8161	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
8162	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
8163	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
8164	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
8165	This is really just another genre picture .
8166	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
8167	William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
8168	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
8169	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
8170	Acting , particularly by Tambor , almost makes `` Never Again '' worthwhile , but -LRB- writer\/director -RRB- Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
8171	Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
8172	`` Collateral Damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
8173	` Enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
8174	A waste of good performances .
8175	A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
8176	I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
8177	But I was n't .
8178	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
8179	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
8180	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
8181	Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
8182	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
8183	Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
8184	Why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson , Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED ?
8185	A broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
8186	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
8187	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
8188	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
8189	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
8190	Wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -LRB- like one of Hubert 's punches -RRB- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
8191	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
8192	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
8193	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
8194	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
8195	Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth -LRB- Mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .
8196	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you 've imagined The Ring .
8197	This time Kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
8198	An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
8199	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
8200	`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
8201	` Unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .
8202	Too bad .
8203	Frenetic but not really funny .
8204	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
8205	If you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
8206	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
8207	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
8208	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
8209	Director Clare Kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
8210	New Best Friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
8211	Wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
8212	The thrill is -LRB- long -RRB- gone .
8213	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
8214	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
8215	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
8216	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
8217	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
8218	... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
8219	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
8220	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
8221	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
8222	Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .
8223	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
8224	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
8225	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
8226	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
8227	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
8228	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
8229	Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
8230	Accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
8231	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
8232	A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
8233	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
8234	Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
8235	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
8236	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
8237	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
8238	It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
8239	`` My god , I 'm behaving like an idiot ! ''
8240	Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .
8241	A dreadful live-action movie .
8242	Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
8243	An earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
8244	A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .
8245	All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
8246	Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
8247	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
8248	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
8249	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
8250	A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
8251	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
8252	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
8253	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
8254	Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
8255	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
8256	Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
8257	Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
8258	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
8259	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
8260	It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
8261	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
8262	A boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash .
8263	What you would end up with if you took Orwell , Bradbury , Kafka , George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender .
8264	But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
8265	With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris , not to mention Sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .
8266	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year 's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
8267	Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
8268	... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
8269	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?
8270	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
8271	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler 's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
8272	It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
8273	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
8274	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
8275	When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
8276	There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
8277	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
8278	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
8279	... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
8280	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
8281	If we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
8282	A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
8283	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
8284	Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
8285	There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
8286	All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
8287	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
8288	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
8289	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
8290	This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .
8291	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
8292	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
8293	So clichÃ©d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
8294	It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
8295	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
8296	When the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
8297	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
8298	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
8299	-LRB- Davis -RRB- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
8300	Does n't amount to much of anything .
8301	Bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
8302	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
8303	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
8304	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
8305	Some of Seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
8306	A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
8307	A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
8308	A little too pat for its own good .
8309	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
8310	Watching Trouble Every Day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
8311	Well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
8312	What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
8313	He 'd create a movie better than this .
8314	When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
8315	A very bad sign .
8316	It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
8317	Ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
8318	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
8319	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
8320	Almost everything else is wan .
8321	I 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
8322	Rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
8323	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
8324	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
8325	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket -LRB- second prize , of course , two free tickets -RRB- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
8326	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
8327	Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
8328	Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .
8329	It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
8330	The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
8331	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
8332	You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
8333	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
8334	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
8335	A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .
8336	The movie bounces all over the map .
8337	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
8338	It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
8339	Not always too whimsical for its own good -LRB- but enough to do harm -RRB- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
8340	`` Juwanna Mann ? ''
8341	No thanks .
8342	Wewannour money back , actually .
8343	It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
8344	You 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
8345	Feel bad for King , who 's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
8346	Some actors steal scenes .
8347	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
8348	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
8349	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
8350	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
8351	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
8352	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
8353	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
8354	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
8355	There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
8356	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
8357	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
8358	The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
8359	Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
8360	Extremely dumb .
8361	Extremely confusing .
8362	Extremely boring .
8363	We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
8364	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
8365	One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
8366	What happened with Pluto Nash ?
8367	How did it ever get made ?
8368	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
8369	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''
8370	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
8371	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
8372	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
8373	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
8374	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
8375	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
8376	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
8377	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
8378	A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
8379	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
8380	It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
8381	It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
8382	It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
8383	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
8384	This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
8385	John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
8386	It 's also stupider .
8387	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
8388	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
8389	As -LRB- the characters -RRB- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
8390	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
8391	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
8392	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
8393	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
8394	Anyone who can count to five -LRB- the film 's target market ? -RRB-
8395	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
8396	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
8397	Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
8398	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
8399	-LRB- Plays -RRB- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
8400	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
8401	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
8402	A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
8403	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
8404	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
8405	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
8406	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
8407	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
8408	All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
8409	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
8410	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
8411	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
8412	As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
8413	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
8414	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
8415	A great idea becomes a not-great movie .
8416	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
8417	And if The Hours wins ` Best Picture ' I just might .
8418	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
8419	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
8420	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
8421	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
8422	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
8423	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
8424	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
8425	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
8426	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
8427	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
8428	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
8429	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
8430	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
8431	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
8432	First good , then bothersome .
8433	Excellent acting and direction .
8434	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
8435	It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
8436	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
8437	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
8438	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
8439	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
8440	A long-winded , predictable scenario .
8441	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
8442	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
8443	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
8444	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
8445	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
8446	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
8447	Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n't pop Reese back .
8448	At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
8449	A real clunker .
8450	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
8451	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
8452	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
8453	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
8454	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
8455	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
8456	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
8457	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
8458	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
8459	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
8460	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
8461	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
8462	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
8463	If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
8464	It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
8465	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
8466	Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
8467	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
8468	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
8469	What kids will discover is a new collectible .
8470	What parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
8471	Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -LRB- but -RRB- the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
8472	Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .
8473	Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .
8474	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
8475	There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
8476	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
8477	Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
8478	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
8479	There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
8480	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
8481	When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
8482	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
8483	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
8484	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
8485	-LRB- It 's -RRB- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
8486	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
8487	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
8488	But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .
8489	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
8490	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
8491	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
8492	Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -LRB- it 's -RRB- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .
8493	What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
8494	If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
8495	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
8496	These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
8497	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
8498	It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
8499	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
8500	The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .
8501	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
8502	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
8503	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
8504	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
8505	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
8506	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
8507	Too simple for its own good .
8508	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
8509	A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
8510	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
8511	The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
8512	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
8513	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
8514	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
8515	Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
8516	Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
8517	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
8518	Any rock pile will do for a set .
8519	Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
8520	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
8521	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
8522	Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
8523	As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
8524	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
8525	The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
8526	A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .
8527	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
8528	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
8529	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?
8530	Ridiculous .
8531	What 's next ?
8532	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
8533	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
8534	The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
8535	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
8536	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
8537	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
8538	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .
8539	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
8540	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
8541	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
8542	No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
8543	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
8544	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
8545	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
8546	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
8547	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
8548	The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
8549	The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .
8550	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
8551	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
8552	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
8553	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
8554	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
8555	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
8556	Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .
8557	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
8558	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
8559	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .
8560	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
8561	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
8562	There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
8563	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
8564	An awkward and indigestible movie .
8565	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
8566	Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .
8567	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
8568	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
8569	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
8570	There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
8571	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
8572	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
8573	Alas , it 's neither .
8574	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
8575	` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
8576	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
8577	Now it 's just tired .
8578	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
8579	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
8580	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
8581	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
8582	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
8583	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
8584	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
8585	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .
8586	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
8587	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
8588	What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
8589	Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
8590	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
8591	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
8592	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
8593	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
8594	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
8595	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
8596	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
8597	With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
8598	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
8599	Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
8600	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
8601	Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
8602	Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .
8603	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
8604	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
8605	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
8606	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
8607	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
8608	Or a profit .
8609	Or some damn thing .
8610	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
8611	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
8612	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
8613	I like Frank the Pug , though .
8614	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
8615	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
8616	Moot point .
8617	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
8618	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
8619	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
8620	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
8621	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
8622	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
8623	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
8624	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
8625	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
8626	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
8627	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
8628	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
8629	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
8630	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
8631	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
8632	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
8633	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
8634	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
8635	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
8636	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
8637	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
8638	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
8639	I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
8640	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
8641	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
8642	Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
8643	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
8644	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
8645	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
8646	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
8647	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
8648	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
8649	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
8650	When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
8651	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
8652	We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
8653	Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie 's -RRB- mindset .
8654	Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
8655	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
8656	Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
8657	-LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
8658	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
8659	For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
8660	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
8661	Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
8662	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
8663	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
8664	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
8665	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
8666	The movie gets muted and routine .
8667	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
8668	It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
8669	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
8670	It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
8671	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
8672	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
8673	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
8674	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
8675	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
8676	Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
8677	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
8678	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
8679	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
8680	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
8681	It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
8682	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
8683	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
8684	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
8685	You 've seen them a million times .
8686	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
8687	This one does .
8688	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
8689	A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
8690	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
8691	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
8692	A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
8693	An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
8694	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
8695	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
8696	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
8697	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e .
8698	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
8699	Boring we did n't .
8700	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
8701	The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
8702	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
8703	A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .
8704	It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
8705	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
8706	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
8707	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
8708	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
8709	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
8710	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
8711	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
8712	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
8713	If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
8714	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
8715	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
8716	Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
8717	A very average science fiction film .
8718	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
8719	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
8720	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
8721	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
8722	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
8723	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
8724	A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
8725	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
8726	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
8727	Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
8728	As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
8729	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
8730	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
8731	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
8732	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
8733	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
8734	While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
8735	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
8736	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
8737	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
8738	None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
8739	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
8740	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
8741	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
8742	... has virtually no script at all ...
8743	Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
8744	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
8745	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
8746	just pound away .
8747	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
8748	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
8749	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
8750	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
8751	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
8752	The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
8753	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
8754	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
8755	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
8756	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
8757	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
8758	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
8759	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
8760	Sorry , Charlie
8761	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
8762	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
8763	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
8764	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
8765	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
8766	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
8767	All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
8768	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
8769	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
8770	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
8771	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
8772	-LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
8773	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
8774	The central story lacks punch .
8775	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
8776	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
8777	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
8778	A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
8779	What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
8780	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
8781	`` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .
8782	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
8783	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
8784	This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
8785	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
8786	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
8787	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
8788	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
8789	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
8790	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
8791	Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
8792	A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
8793	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
8794	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
8795	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
8796	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
8797	It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
8798	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
8799	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
8800	Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
8801	While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .
8802	Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
8803	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
8804	I loved looking at this movie .
8805	I just did n't care as much for the story .
8806	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
8807	It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
8808	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
8809	A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
8810	A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
8811	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
8812	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
8813	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
8814	It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
8815	Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
8816	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
8817	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
8818	Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
8819	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
8820	To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
8821	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
8822	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
8823	Ecks this one off your must-see list .
8824	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .
8825	It settles for being merely grim .
8826	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
8827	It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
8828	No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
8829	Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
8830	Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -LRB- or during -RRB- consumption of its second half .
8831	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
8832	The New Guy is one of them .
8833	This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
8834	Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
8835	If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
8836	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
8837	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
8838	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
8839	All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
8840	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
8841	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
8842	The film 's center will not hold .
8843	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
8844	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
8845	A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
8846	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
8847	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
8848	As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
8849	A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
8850	I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
8851	Nothing about it fits .
8852	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
8853	Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
8854	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
8855	Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
8856	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
8857	I tried to read the time on my watch .
8858	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
8859	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
8860	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
8861	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
8862	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
8863	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
8864	Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
8865	There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
8866	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
8867	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
8868	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
8869	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
8870	Just a bloody mess .
8871	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
8872	You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
8873	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
8874	Bears is bad .
8875	Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .
8876	As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
8877	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
8878	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
8879	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
8880	Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it .
8881	What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
8882	What will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
8883	... too dull to enjoy .
8884	A morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense .
8885	Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
8886	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
8887	But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
8888	A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
8889	It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
8890	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
8891	Going to the website may be just as fun -LRB- and scary -RRB- as going to the film .
8892	Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
8893	Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
8894	Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .
8895	For Caine Lovers only .
8896	A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
8897	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
8898	But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
8899	No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
8900	A reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
8901	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
8902	Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
8903	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
8904	But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
8905	The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
8906	What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
8907	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
8908	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
8909	A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .
8910	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
8911	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
8912	And forget about any attempt at a plot !
8913	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
8914	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .
8915	It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
8916	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
8917	It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
8918	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
8919	` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
8920	Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
8921	Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .
8922	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
8923	Barely goes beyond comic book status .
8924	It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
8925	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
8926	It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
8927	An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
8928	Afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , All the Queen 's Men is finally just one long drag .
8929	Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
8930	-LRB- Morgan -RRB- , Judd and Franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by Joseph Finder , from some opportunism .
8931	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
8932	Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
8933	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
8934	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
8935	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
8936	It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
8937	It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
8938	A sudsy cautionary tale .
8939	A movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess .
8940	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
8941	Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
8942	Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
8943	Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
8944	As your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
8945	Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
8946	On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
8947	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
8948	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
8949	... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
8950	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
8951	The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
8952	Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .
8953	-LRB- Sen 's -RRB- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
8954	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
8955	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
8956	Do n't waste your money .
8957	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
8958	There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
8959	There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
8960	Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
8961	We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .
8962	You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .
8963	Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
8964	Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
8965	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
8966	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it 's called Where 's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
8967	This film is full of rabbits .
8968	Brimful .
8969	But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
8970	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
8971	I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .
8972	No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
8973	A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to .
8974	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
8975	In a word -- yes .
8976	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
8977	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
8978	The movie makes absolutely no sense .
8979	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
8980	The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
8981	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
8982	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
8983	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
8984	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
8985	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
8986	The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
8987	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
8988	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
8989	Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
8990	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
8991	A TV episode inflated past its natural length .
8992	Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
8993	All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
8994	There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
8995	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
8996	The story ... is moldy and obvious .
8997	It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
8998	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
8999	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
9000	Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
9001	Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
9002	Usually when I get this much syrup , I like pancakes to go with it .
9003	All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
9004	Glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
9005	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
9006	An overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
9007	Without a strong script and energetic acting , Dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos .
9008	A mild , reluctant , thumbs down .
9009	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
9010	Schindler 's List it ai n't .
9011	A cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
9012	It 's an awfully derivative story .
9013	The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naÃ¯vetÃ© and arbitrary flashbacks .
9014	It 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
9015	About as cutting-edge as Pet Rock : The Movie .
9016	With generic sets and B-grade special effects , Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as TV 's defunct Cleopatra 2525 .
9017	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
9018	Winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
9019	Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
9020	The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
9021	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
9022	With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .
9023	It 's painful .
9024	Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
9025	An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
9026	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
9027	An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
9028	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
9029	Writer\/director John McKay ignites some charming chemistry between Kate and Jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and Kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
9030	-LRB- Newton -RRB- wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
9031	Unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
9032	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
9033	A lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
9034	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
9035	Then lower them a bit more .
9036	When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray 's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean .
9037	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
9038	A woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
9039	` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .
9040	What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
9041	A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
9042	Birot 's directorial debut -LRB- she co-wrote the script with Christophe HonorÃ© -RRB- is n't so much bad as it is bland .
9043	Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
9044	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
9045	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
9046	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
9047	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
9048	A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .
9049	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
9050	`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
9051	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
9052	What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
9053	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
9054	While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
9055	Just how extreme are these ops ?
9056	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
9057	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
9058	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
9059	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
9060	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
9061	Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .
9062	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
9063	... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
9064	The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
9065	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman -LRB- who never gets to play that flute -RRB- has all the charm of a meltdown .
9066	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
9067	It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
9068	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
9069	None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
9070	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
9071	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
9072	Fails to bring as much to the table .
9073	A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
9074	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
9075	If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
9076	I hate this movie
9077	It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
9078	Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
9079	At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
9080	... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
9081	A DOA dud from frame one .
9082	Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
9083	There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .
9084	Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
9085	The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .
9086	First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .
9087	Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
9088	Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
9089	The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
9090	A predictable , manipulative stinker .
9091	The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
9092	Eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .
9093	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
9094	The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
9095	It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
9096	An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
9097	once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
9098	The dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically .
9099	The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
9100	What 's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses -LRB- and one Academy Award winning actor -RRB- succumb to appearing in this junk that 's TV sitcom material at best .
9101	No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
9102	Where their heads were is anyone 's guess .
9103	Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
9104	A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
9105	Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2Â 1\/2 - hour , dissipated length .
9106	A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .
9107	Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
9108	I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
9109	Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
9110	Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
9111	One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
9112	Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?
9113	A selection of scenes in search of a movie .
9114	-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
9115	Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
9116	True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
9117	-LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
9118	The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
9119	You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
9120	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
9121	A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
9122	Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
9123	As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
9124	Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
9125	Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
9126	The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
9127	While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .
9128	Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
9129	A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
9130	A Lifetime movie about men .
9131	The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .
9132	It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
9133	It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
9134	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
9135	The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
9136	I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
9137	If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
9138	This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
9139	Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
9140	I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
9141	This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '
9142	than ` Magnifique ' .
9143	The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
9144	Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
9145	But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
9146	Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .
9147	I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
9148	Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
9149	is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
9150	Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
9151	This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
9152	Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
9153	Who is this movie for ?
9154	Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .
9155	It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
9156	A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
9157	It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
9158	Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''
9159	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
9160	It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
9161	Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
9162	Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
9163	For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
9164	A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
9165	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
9166	Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
9167	Originality is sorely lacking .
9168	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
9169	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
9170	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
9171	Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .
9172	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .
9173	For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
9174	There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
9175	Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
9176	I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
9177	It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
9178	-LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .
9179	Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
9180	Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
9181	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
9182	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
9183	Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
9184	The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
9185	It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
9186	This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
9187	Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
9188	Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
9189	Every note rings false .
9190	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
9191	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
9192	Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
9193	This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .
9194	This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
9195	The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
9196	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
9197	A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
9198	-LRB- Less a movie than -RRB- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own \*\*\* in embarrassment .
9199	The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
9200	It 's too bad nothing else is .
9201	Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
9202	El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .
9203	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
9204	A serious movie with serious ideas .
9205	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
9206	There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
9207	The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
9208	I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
9209	What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
9210	-LRB- A -RRB- painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
9211	Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
9212	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
9213	It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
9214	I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
9215	The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
9216	The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
9217	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
9218	There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
9219	It drowns in sap .
9220	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
9221	It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
9222	I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
9223	There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
9224	The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list .
9225	The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
9226	Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .
9227	It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
9228	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
9229	Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .
9230	Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .
9231	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
9232	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichÃ©s .
9233	Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
9234	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
9235	A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
9236	The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
9237	The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
9238	Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
9239	It 's all surface psychodramatics .
9240	The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .
9241	That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .
9242	Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
9243	For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
9244	Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
9245	Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
9246	An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
9247	too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
9248	There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
9249	A wordy wisp of a comedy .
9250	Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
9251	-LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .
9252	Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .
9253	A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
9254	Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
9255	A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .
9256	The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
9257	Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .
9258	I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all .
9259	It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
9260	Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .
9261	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
9262	After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .
9263	Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
9264	It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
9265	If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .
9266	Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
9267	There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .
9268	The same should go for movie theaters .
9269	Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .
9270	The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
9271	As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs .
9272	This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
9273	The crap continues .
9274	Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 11 -RRB- .
9275	High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
9276	Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
9277	One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
9278	When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
9279	Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
9280	The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
9281	Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
9282	As it stands , there 's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more .
9283	I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
9284	The picture does n't know it 's a comedy .
9285	A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
9286	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
9287	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
9288	Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .
9289	Lan Yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that Happy Together shoots for -LRB- and misses -RRB- .
9290	This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .
9291	Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .
9292	Much like Robin Williams , Death to Smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
9293	An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .
9294	A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .
9295	An often unfunny romp .
9296	A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special .
9297	Twenty years later , Reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .
9298	Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .
9299	We have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .
9300	Despite Hoffman 's best efforts , Wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before .
9301	There 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side .
9302	The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
9303	Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
9304	Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .
9305	While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
9306	The origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books .
9307	It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
9308	Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder .
9309	Seagal , who looks more like Danny Aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
9310	The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
9311	Lacks dramatic punch and depth .
9312	There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman 's whimsical comedy Very Annie-Mary but not enough to sustain the film .
9313	I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .
9314	Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '
9315	Make like the title and dodge this one .
9316	This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .
9317	The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .
9318	Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
9319	It 's obvious -LRB- Je-Gyu is -RRB- trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .
9320	Sweet Home Alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end .
9321	-LRB- Green is -RRB- the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
9322	No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .
9323	A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
9324	Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
9325	Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .
9326	Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
9327	It is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by Southern blacks as distilled through a Caucasian perspective .
9328	It 's tough being a black man in America , especially when the Man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .
9329	A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours -LRB- and , for that matter , Shrek -RRB- .
9330	An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
9331	The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
9332	Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
9333	Unofficially , National Lampoon 's Van Wilder is Son of Animal House .
9334	Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
9335	This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
9336	Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns .
9337	Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
9338	It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .
9339	will be far more interesting to the Soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by Julia Roberts ...
9340	Authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .
9341	Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible
9342	Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
9343	The filmmaker ascends , literally , to the Olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .
9344	The screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as Hip-Hop Scooby-Doo .
9345	Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...
9346	Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
9347	... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
9348	A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .
9349	Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
9350	Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
9351	The film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .
9352	A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
9353	Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .
9354	It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
9355	A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
9356	... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
9357	Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
9358	As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .
9359	Eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , Caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .
9360	To work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer .
9361	That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
9362	Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
9363	A puzzle whose pieces do not fit .
9364	Some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie .
9365	Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
9366	The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .
9367	` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
9368	Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
9369	a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
9370	In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable
9371	An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .
9372	A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
9373	So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .
9374	A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .
9375	`` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .
9376	Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
9377	Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
9378	Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .
9379	entertaining enough , but nothing new
9380	... one resurrection too many .
9381	This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
9382	Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
9383	DeMeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material .
9384	In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
9385	No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .
9386	Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .
9387	A timid , soggy near miss .
9388	Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .
9389	To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
9390	Observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout Maelstrom .
9391	This version of H.G. Wells ' Time Machine was directed by H.G. Wells ' great-grandson .
9392	They should have found Orson Welles ' great-grandson .
9393	Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .
9394	With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .
9395	Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together .
9396	... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges .
9397	There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
9398	Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .
9399	Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
9400	The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .
9401	The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
9402	This is not a Jackie Chan movie .
9403	It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
9404	And that makes all the difference .
9405	Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
9406	The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
9407	A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
9408	No big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
9409	I do n't think this movie loves women at all .
9410	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .
9411	A negligible British comedy .
9412	Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
9413	Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
9414	Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .
9415	What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?
9416	Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` Gadzooks ! ''
9417	Her film is like a beautiful food entrÃ©e that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
9418	Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
9419	No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
9420	Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
9421	In the end , there is n't much to it .
9422	A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .
9423	The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .
9424	Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .
9425	Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
9426	You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
9427	Directors Harry Gantz and Joe Gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves are n't all that interesting .
9428	Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .
9429	for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience
9430	Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .
9431	Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue ?
9432	It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
9433	Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
9434	Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern .
9435	Like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .
9436	Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
9437	The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
9438	These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .
9439	Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .
9440	Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp ca n't sustain it .
9441	Finally coming down off of Miramax 's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , Waking Up in Reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .
9442	A movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action TV series .
9443	One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
9444	The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .
9445	Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
9446	Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .
9447	The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .
9448	Devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered CGI effects .
9449	Anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in ` The Ring . '
9450	A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy French grandfather .
9451	The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
9452	both overstuffed and undernourished ... The film ca n't be called a solid success , although there 's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time .
9453	Plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made Miike ... a cult hero .
9454	Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock 's imaginative flight to Shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff .
9455	The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart-string plucking .
9456	I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon .
9457	I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
9458	It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
9459	The plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back .
9460	This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
9461	No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .
9462	Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter .
9463	-LRB- Taylor -RRB- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .
9464	It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .
9465	Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .
9466	Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and clichÃ© .
9467	The most remarkable -LRB- and frustrating -RRB- thing about World Traveler , which opens today in Manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank .
9468	An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .
9469	The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
9470	With lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- Max is static , stilted .
9471	Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
9472	Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .
9473	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
9474	In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
9475	The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .
9476	Make no mistake , ivans xtc .
9477	is a mess .
9478	Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .
9479	The concept is a hoot .
9480	The trailer is a riot .
9481	The movie is a dud .
9482	It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
9483	Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
9484	It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
9485	Some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema .
9486	These characters become wearisome .
9487	A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
9488	This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .
9489	Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotionally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
9490	A sterling film - a cross between Boys Do n't Cry , Deliverance , and Ode to Billy Joe - lies somewhere in the story of Matthew Shepard , but that film is yet to be made .
9491	After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
9492	Contrived pastiche of caper clichÃ©s .
9493	Many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .
9494	Just a Kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people .
9495	But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .
9496	The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield .
9497	Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .
9498	Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
9499	Yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other 's existence .
9500	Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
9501	I ca n't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there 's only one problem ... it 's supposed to be a drama .
9502	Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
9503	Well , Jason 's gone to Manhattan and Hell , I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels -LRB- hey , do n't shoot the messenger -RRB- .
9504	Donovan ... squanders his main asset , Jackie Chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
9505	There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
9506	Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
9507	It may even fall into the category of Films You Love to Hate .
9508	I admit it , I hate to like it .
9509	Frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for .
9510	Leaks treacle from every pore .
9511	The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon\/Bourne or his predicament .
9512	Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
9513	While we want MacDowell 's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .
9514	Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides .
9515	... The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .
9516	If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .
9517	Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .
9518	The film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design .
9519	A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
9520	A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .
9521	A plodding look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .
9522	Tom Shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing Adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .
9523	Unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .
9524	A fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .
9525	Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .
9526	... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .
9527	Your taste for Jonah - A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit .
9528	Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
9529	While certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , Jeong-Hyang Lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
9530	The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .
9531	A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
9532	A collage of clichÃ©s and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
9533	The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
9534	Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .
9535	An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
9536	How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
9537	There are some laughs in this movie , but Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
9538	As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
9539	The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .
9540	The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .
9541	Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
9542	This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .
9543	The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for Disney sequels .
9544	... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
9545	... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''
9546	If Disney 's Cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then Cinderella II proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes .
9547	Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .
9548	With Rare Birds , as with The Shipping News before it , an attempt is made to transplant a Hollywood star into Newfoundland 's wild soil -- and The Rock once again resists the intrusion .
9549	Nothing about this movie works .
9550	If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .
9551	A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
9552	None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...
9553	Are monsters born , or made ?
9554	Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
9555	The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures Esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and Esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .
9556	It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .
9557	With the dog days of August upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .
9558	Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
9559	The film is like sitting in a downtown cafÃ© , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
9560	This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
9561	Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright , poet and drinker .
9562	Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest .
9563	A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
9564	Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .
9565	Collapses under its own meager weight .
9566	This is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .
9567	If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you 're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .
9568	Technically and artistically inept .
9569	Those who are only mildly curious , I fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .
9570	Though Tom Shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
9571	A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .
9572	Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .
9573	Death might be a release .
9574	`` -LRB- Hopkins -RRB- does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it .
9575	No , even that 's too committed .
9576	He gets his secretary to fax it . ''
9577	Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .
9578	Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .
9579	A beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic . '
9580	Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .
9581	This is a third-person story now , told by Hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
9582	The filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .
9583	Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .
9584	The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours .
9585	Very well made , but does n't generate a lot of tension .
9586	Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .
9587	You leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .
9588	It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .
9589	The question hanging over The Time Machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '
9590	but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '
9591	Millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .
9592	`` Freaky Friday , '' it 's not .
9593	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
9594	Although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success .
9595	In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .
9596	Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .
9597	The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .
9598	This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .
9599	For the rest of us , sitting through Dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .
9600	Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .
9601	Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
9602	A tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship .
9603	Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
9604	An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
9605	The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
9606	A glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick .
9607	... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .
9608	It 's just plain boring .
9609	Sad nonsense , this .
9610	But not without cheesy fun factor .
9611	One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
9612	Really dumb but occasionally really funny .
9613	The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
9614	The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
9615	While the transgressive trappings -LRB- especially the frank sex scenes -RRB- ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
9616	The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
9617	They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
9618	It 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man clichÃ© atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of -LRB- Woo 's -RRB- best work .
9619	Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script
9620	If you 're over 25 , have an IQ over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
9621	The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .
9622	... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .
9623	Never does `` Lilo & Stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` Mulan '' or `` Tarzan . ''
9624	One of those so-so films that could have been much better .
9625	Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
9626	Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
9627	Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .
9628	Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
9629	It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
9630	It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
9631	Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .
9632	It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
9633	Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .
9634	The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
9635	No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .
9636	Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .
9637	Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .
9638	-LRB- T -RRB- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .
9639	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
9640	An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
9641	Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
9642	A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '
9643	... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .
9644	Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
9645	What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .
9646	The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .
9647	Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .
9648	Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ...
9649	Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
9650	By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .
9651	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
9652	A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
9653	Pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .
9654	It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
9655	Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
9656	It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
9657	A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
9658	It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
9659	Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?
9660	It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .
9661	This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
9662	A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
9663	Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .
9664	Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
9665	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
9666	Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .
9667	Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
9668	More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .
9669	The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
9670	Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
9671	Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market .
9672	Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .
9673	It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
9674	On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .
9675	The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
9676	... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
9677	Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
9678	Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '
9679	scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens .
9680	Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .
9681	Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
9682	The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
9683	A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
9684	It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
9685	-LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
9686	Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
9687	So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
9688	Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .
9689	Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .
9690	Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
9691	Very stupid and annoying .
9692	The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .
9693	A listless and desultory affair .
9694	Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .
9695	How inept is Serving Sara ?
9696	It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
9697	Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .
9698	Every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked .
9699	Wins my vote for ` The 2002 Enemy of Cinema ' Award .
9700	Any Chekhov is better than no Chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .
9701	Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
9702	Lazy , miserable and smug .
9703	This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
9704	Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market .
9705	Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .
9706	There 's no energy .
9707	Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
9708	After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
9709	This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
9710	At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
9711	A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .
9712	A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .
9713	The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
9714	If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .
9715	This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
9716	Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .
9717	Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up .
9718	There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
9719	It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
9720	All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
9721	A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
9722	Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
9723	The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
9724	Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
9725	At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .
9726	Your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but .
9727	Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
9728	Elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke .
9729	If you 're looking for a tale of Brits behaving badly , watch Snatch again .
9730	It 's 51 times better than this .
9731	It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
9732	Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '
9733	Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
9734	Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
9735	Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
9736	Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
9737	There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .
9738	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
9739	There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .
9740	While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
9741	A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
9742	Go , girls , right down the reality drain .
9743	Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
9744	Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
9745	Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
9746	... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
9747	The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
9748	An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
9749	Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
9750	Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
9751	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
9752	` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .
9753	At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
9754	It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
9755	Wanker Goths are on the loose !
9756	Run for your lives !
9757	Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
9758	A grating , emaciated flick .
9759	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
9760	Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
9761	We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
9762	According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .
9763	But you 'd never guess that from the performances .
9764	The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
9765	Ararat feels like a book report
9766	Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .
9767	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
9768	An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .
9769	The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
9770	Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about
9771	With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .
9772	Alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .
9773	The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
9774	This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
9775	The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
9776	Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome clichÃ© .
9777	the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
9778	Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .
9779	Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
9780	The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
9781	Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' .
9782	If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
9783	If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
9784	With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
9785	Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .
9786	A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
9787	Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '
9788	This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
9789	The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
9790	De Niro cries .
9791	You 'll cry for your money back .
9792	Slap me , I saw this movie .
9793	-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
9794	Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
9795	Quelle surprise !
9796	Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .
9797	Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
9798	Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
9799	The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .
9800	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
9801	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
9802	So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
9803	In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
9804	Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichÃ©s .
9805	Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .
9806	One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
9807	There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
9808	` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
9809	The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
9810	Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .
9811	In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
9812	Five screenwriters are credited with the clichÃ©-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
9813	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
9814	Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
9815	So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
9816	The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
9817	Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
9818	` Snow Dogs ' has both .
9819	It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
9820	Wobbly Senegalese updating of `` Carmen '' which is best for the stunning star turn by Djeinaba Diop Gai
9821	It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
9822	Ken Russell would love this .
9823	In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .
9824	Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies .
9825	This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
9826	The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
9827	What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .
9828	A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .
9829	Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
9830	The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects .
9831	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
9832	The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
9833	The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
9834	What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
9835	The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
9836	Opera on film is never satisfactory .
9837	The art demands live viewing .
9838	The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
9839	Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
9840	It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
9841	The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
9842	It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
9843	Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
9844	As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
9845	Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
9846	A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .
9847	Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .
9848	Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
9849	A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
9850	The story has little wit and no surprises .
9851	The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
9852	What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
9853	Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?
9854	I did n't think so .
9855	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
9856	-LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
9857	The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
9858	... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .
9859	This Scarlet 's letter is A. . .
9860	as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
9861	Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
9862	The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .
9863	A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .
9864	A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
9865	Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
9866	A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
9867	There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .
9868	It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
9869	The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .
9870	She 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life .
9871	A quaint , romanticized rendering .
9872	What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song .
9873	The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
9874	A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
9875	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .
9876	Now he makes them .
9877	She 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ...
9878	Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
9879	Been there done that .
9880	There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .
9881	A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
9882	Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
9883	Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
9884	Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
9885	A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
9886	A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
9887	We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
9888	It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .
9889	Bravado Kathy !
9890	... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
9891	Too bad .
9892	You can thank me for this .
9893	I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to .
9894	Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
9895	Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .
9896	This romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
9897	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
9898	There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings .
9899	Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition .
9900	It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
9901	The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
9902	Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
9903	If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .
9904	A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
9905	If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .
9906	Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .
9907	What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
9908	Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
9909	An uninspired preachy and clichÃ©d war film .
9910	Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
9911	A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people .
9912	Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
9913	If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
9914	The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
9915	I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .
9916	Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
9917	Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
9918	A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .
9919	The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
9920	The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
9921	Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
9922	It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mÃ©tier .
9923	How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
9924	When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.
9925	There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .
9926	The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .
9927	It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
9928	The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
9929	Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
9930	The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .
9931	Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
9932	-LRB- Seems -RRB- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
9933	It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
9934	Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .
9935	If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
9936	What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .
9937	The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .
9938	It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
9939	Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
9940	It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
9941	Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .
9942	Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .
9943	Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
9944	Something must have been lost in the translation .
9945	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .
9946	In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
9947	Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
9948	Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .
9949	Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .
9950	Action - mechanical .
9951	`` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .
9952	Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .
9953	For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .
9954	The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
9955	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .
9956	Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .
9957	City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .
9958	But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .
9959	Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .
9960	As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .
9961	There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious .
9962	I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .
9963	What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .
9964	Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .
9965	The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
9966	Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
9967	Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
9968	Amid the clichÃ© and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn .
9969	Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
9970	No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild .
9971	Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
9972	Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .
9973	There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
9974	It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
9975	There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .
9976	We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .
9977	Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
9978	There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
9979	The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .
9980	I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .
9981	Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
9982	Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .
9983	... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
9984	Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
9985	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
9986	To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
9987	Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
9988	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .
9989	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
9990	How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?
9991	In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .
9992	Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .
9993	Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
9994	The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .
9995	-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
9996	Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
9997	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .
9998	Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .
9999	The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '
10000	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '
10001	In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
10002	It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .
10003	So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals .
10004	an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades
10005	The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
10006	Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
10007	There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
10008	A cockeyed shot all the way .
10009	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
10010	Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
10011	Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
10012	Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .
10013	The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
10014	Seems like someone going through the motions .
10015	For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .
10016	Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
10017	Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .
10018	Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
10019	Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
10020	Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '
10021	One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
10022	A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
10023	It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
10024	brought to life on the big screen .
10025	The story itself is actually quite vapid .
10026	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
10027	Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .
10028	A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .
10029	Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
10030	Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
10031	Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
10032	One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
10033	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
10034	Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
10035	It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
10036	That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
10037	What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
10038	The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
10039	In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
10040	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
10041	Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
10042	No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
10043	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
10044	A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
10045	Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
10046	It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
10047	For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
10048	A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
10049	A faster paced family flick .
10050	Upper Teens may get cynical .
10051	Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
10052	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
10053	It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
10054	Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
10055	It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
10056	`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .
10057	The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
10058	It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
10059	I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
10060	By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
10061	For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .
10062	It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .
10063	made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .
10064	But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
10065	If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .
10066	But it was n't .
10067	For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
10068	... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .
10069	It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
10070	The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
10071	A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
10072	Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
10073	It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
10074	With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
10075	Does n't really add up to much .
10076	It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
10077	An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
10078	A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
10079	Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
10080	It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
10081	A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '
10082	The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
10083	Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
10084	It 's like a drive-by .
10085	You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
10086	Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .
10087	This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .
10088	Stress ` dumb . '
10089	The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
10090	When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?
10091	It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
10092	This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
10093	A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
10094	Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
10095	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
10096	As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
10097	The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .
10098	Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
10099	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
10100	Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .
10101	When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
10102	Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .
10103	A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .
10104	-LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .
10105	No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
10106	` Hey Arnold ! '
10107	has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
10108	They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .
10109	A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
10110	A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .
10111	Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
10112	It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
10113	The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
10114	tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1973 film , `` The Sting . ''
10115	Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichÃ©s .
10116	It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .
10117	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
10118	The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .
10119	A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
10120	Falls short in explaining the music and its roots .
10121	Never inspires more than an interested detachment .
10122	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
10123	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
10124	Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
10125	They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
10126	A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
10127	It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
10128	Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
10129	It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
10130	These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
10131	Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
10132	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
10133	Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
10134	Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .
10135	Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences .
10136	Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
10137	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
10138	One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .
10139	Phoned-in business as usual .
10140	There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .
10141	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
10142	Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .
10143	Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
10144	The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
10145	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
10146	It 's that painful .
10147	God is great , the movie 's not .
10148	Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
10149	When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
10150	Or else a doggie winks .
10151	A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
10152	As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .
10153	Plays like John Le CarrÃ© with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
10154	You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
10155	It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .
10156	Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
10157	A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .
10158	-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
10159	Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
10160	The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it
10161	Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
10162	It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
10163	Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
10164	I did n't find much fascination in the swinging .
10165	What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .
10166	But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .
10167	The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
10168	After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father clichÃ© has been unturned .
10169	But no. .
10170	Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
10171	Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .
10172	Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .
10173	It was a dark and stormy night ...
10174	A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
10175	This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang 's forte and it shows .
10176	Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
10177	Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .
10178	a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
10179	Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .
10180	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
10181	What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
10182	Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
10183	Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory .
10184	Even with Harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .
10185	The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
10186	Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?
10187	is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
10188	While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
10189	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .
10190	Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
10191	Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .
10192	It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
10193	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
10194	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters
10195	Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role .
10196	High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
10197	Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .
10198	The chocolate factory without Charlie .
10199	Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
10200	Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .
10201	A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
10202	Deserving of its critical backlash and more .
10203	Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .
10204	Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
10205	The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .
10206	The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .
10207	This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
10208	It recycles every clichÃ© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
10209	I 'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .
10210	May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
10211	Many of Benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice .
10212	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
10213	Most folks with a real stake in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .
10214	If you 're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake .
10215	Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .
10216	Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .
10217	Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .
10218	All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .
10219	The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
10220	... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
10221	The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .
10222	No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
10223	Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
10224	Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
10225	The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '
10226	Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .
10227	More tiring than anything .
10228	Nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself .
10229	It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
10230	... the efforts of its star , Kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .
10231	A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .
10232	Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?
10233	And it 's a lousy one at that .
10234	Overly long and worshipful bio-doc .
10235	I 'll go out on a limb .
10236	It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
10237	It 's just merely very bad .
10238	Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .
10239	About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men .
10240	Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
10241	Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
10242	In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
10243	The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
10244	Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
10245	Meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .
10246	A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .
10247	A road trip that will get you thinking , ` Are we there yet ? '
10248	Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
10249	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
10250	If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
10251	An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
10252	What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
10253	The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
10254	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
10255	Nevertheless , it still seems endless .
10256	It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
10257	It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .
10258	And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .
10259	Dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy .
10260	Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
10261	It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
10262	The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .
10263	Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
10264	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
10265	Brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .
10266	Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .
10267	Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
10268	The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .
10269	displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver
10270	So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .
10271	An awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work .
10272	The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .
10273	Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .
10274	Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .
10275	Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
10276	It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
10277	Rosenthal -LRB- Halloween II -RRB- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .
10278	Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .
10279	Rodriguez ... was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .
10280	A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .
10281	Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .
10282	This is n't a terrible film by any means , but it 's also far from being a realized work .
10283	Apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present Hollywood program .
10284	Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
10285	Only masochistic moviegoers need apply .
10286	A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .
10287	Not bad , but not all that good .
10288	Bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price .
10289	What 's next ?
10290	Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ?
10291	David Spade as Citizen Kane ?
10292	Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .
10293	The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .
10294	It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
10295	Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
10296	On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
10297	I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
10298	It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
10299	After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .
10300	We get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .
10301	Summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .
10302	The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
10303	Often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns What Time Is It There ?
10304	into How Long Is This Movie ?
10305	Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .
10306	Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
10307	It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .
10308	Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .
10309	It 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end .
10310	A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
10311	An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
10312	Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .
10313	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
10314	These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
10315	The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
10316	Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
10317	The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .
10318	... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids .
10319	A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .
10320	The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .
10321	Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .
10322	A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .
10323	... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc .
10324	Reyes ' word processor .
10325	Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .
10326	It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .
10327	A little objectivity could have gone a long way .
10328	One of the worst films of 2002 .
10329	I believe Silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them .
10330	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
10331	McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
10332	High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
10333	This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
10334	The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
10335	This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
10336	An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
10337	The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
10338	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
10339	The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
10340	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
10341	The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other .
10342	The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
10343	Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
10344	After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
10345	` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '
10346	A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
10347	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
10348	If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
10349	It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
10350	Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
10351	The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
10352	A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
10353	Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
10354	Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .
10355	-LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .
10356	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
10357	If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .
10358	Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
10359	Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
10360	Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .
10361	It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
10362	Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .
10363	The camera whirls !
10364	The camera twirls !
10365	Oh , look at that clever angle !
10366	Wow , a jump cut !
10367	Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
10368	The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
10369	It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
10370	It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
10371	Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
10372	Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
10373	-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
10374	Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
10375	A ragbag of cliches .
10376	This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .
10377	The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
10378	It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
10379	This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
10380	Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .
10381	Has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure .
10382	What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?
10383	Collateral Damage offers formula payback and the Big Payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .
10384	The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a soufflÃ© gone wrong .
10385	Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
10386	You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?
10387	Just send it to Cranky .
10388	We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
10389	An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .
10390	The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .
10391	The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
10392	The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .
10393	No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
10394	Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .
10395	One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .
10396	Proof of this is Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever .
10397	Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .
10398	Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
10399	We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .
10400	Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .
10401	There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
10402	` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '
10403	The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .
10404	Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .
10405	This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
10406	The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .
10407	Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .
10408	Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
10409	Every joke is repeated at least four times .
10410	Every joke is repeated at least four times .
10411	Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ?
10412	Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
10413	The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
10414	Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
10415	-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
10416	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
10417	Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
10418	A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
10419	Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .
10420	They cheapen the overall effect .
10421	Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
10422	An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
10423	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
10424	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
10425	Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
10426	The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
10427	Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
10428	The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
10429	Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
10430	The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
10431	More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
10432	It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
10433	A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
10434	It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
10435	It 's not original enough .
10436	A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
10437	Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
10438	A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
10439	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
10440	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
10441	The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
10442	Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
10443	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
10444	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
10445	For free .
10446	I still want my money back .
10447	It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
10448	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
10449	All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
10450	... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
10451	Strictly middle of the road .
10452	Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
10453	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichÃ©s , depression and bad alternative music .
10454	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .
10455	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
10456	With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
10457	`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .
10458	A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .
10459	Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .
10460	Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
10461	Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
10462	Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
10463	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
10464	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
10465	Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
10466	Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
10467	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
10468	How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- FranÃ§ois and MichÃ¨le 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
10469	They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
10470	Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
10471	The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .
10472	Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
10473	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
10474	The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
10475	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
10476	Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .
10477	Enigma lacks it .
10478	Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
10479	... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .
10480	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
10481	Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
10482	In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
10483	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pÃ¨re-fils confrontations .
10484	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
10485	Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
10486	New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...
10487	Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
10488	Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
10489	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
10490	A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
10491	Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
10492	But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
10493	You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
10494	An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
10495	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
10496	The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
10497	Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
10498	Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
10499	Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
10500	Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
10501	The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
10502	For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ?
10503	lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
10504	Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
10505	But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
10506	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
10507	It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
10508	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
10509	For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .
10510	There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
10511	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
10512	It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
10513	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
10514	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
10515	Dreary tale of middle-class angst
10516	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
10517	-LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
10518	Lillard and Cardellini earn their Scooby Snacks , but not anyone else .
10519	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
10520	An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
10521	-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .
10522	It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
10523	Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .
10524	Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .
10525	A decidedly mixed bag .
10526	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
10527	Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
10528	Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
10529	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
10530	Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .
10531	Just dreadful .
10532	I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
10533	Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films .
10534	hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
10535	This is just lazy writing .
10536	Even kids deserve better .
10537	The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .
10538	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .
10539	Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .
10540	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .
10541	Frank Capra played this story straight .
10542	But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .
10543	How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?
10544	The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
10545	Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .
10546	Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflÃ© .
10547	`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
10548	A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
10549	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
10550	It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .
10551	An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .
10552	Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
10553	Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
10554	Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
10555	Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
10556	All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
10557	This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
10558	I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
10559	But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
10560	Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
10561	What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
10562	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
10563	Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
10564	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .
10565	None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
10566	The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .
10567	` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '
10568	At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
10569	The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .
10570	While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .
10571	A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .
10572	What 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle ?
10573	Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .
10574	With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
10575	The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
10576	What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .
10577	Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
10578	With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
10579	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
10580	Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
10581	Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .
10582	You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
10583	A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
10584	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
10585	Seriously , rent the Disney version .
10586	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .
10587	Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .
10588	It ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to .
10589	`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
10590	Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
10591	A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
10592	A loquacious and dreary piece of business .
10593	What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -LRB- dark green , to be exact -RRB- , sour , bloody and mean .
10594	director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention
10595	Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
10596	Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
10597	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
10598	I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
10599	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
10600	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
10601	The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
10602	Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
10603	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
10604	The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
10605	If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear .
10606	This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
10607	A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .
10608	He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan 's Privates .
10609	But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either .
10610	May puzzle his most ardent fans .
10611	Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
10612	We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
10613	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .
10614	Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose Madonna .
10615	The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .
10616	Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
10617	While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . ''
10618	The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
10619	... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
10620	More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
10621	TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
10622	-LRB- Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are -RRB- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
10623	If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
10624	It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
10625	Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
10626	Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
10627	Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
10628	This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
10629	Feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .
10630	Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
10631	Vulgar is too optimistic a title .
10632	The actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect .
10633	The characters never change .
10634	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
10635	Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .
10636	Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
10637	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
10638	A bad movie that happened to good actors .
10639	Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
10640	Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .
10641	Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
10642	That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .
10643	It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
10644	Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .
10645	If you saw Benigni 's Pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
10646	The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
10647	The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .
10648	Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
10649	Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .
10650	In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .
10651	-LRB- T -RRB- he ideas of Revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution
10652	The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .
10653	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
10654	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .
10655	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
10656	Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
10657	Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
10658	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
10659	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
10660	-LRB- A -RRB- stale retread of the '53 original .
10661	One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
10662	For dance completists only .
10663	Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
10664	It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .
10665	The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
10666	Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .
10667	I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .
10668	This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
10669	Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
10670	Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
10671	Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .
10672	Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .
10673	The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
10674	Low comedy does n't come much lower .
10675	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .
10676	It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
10677	One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .
10678	This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
10679	Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .
10680	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
10681	An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .
10682	The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
10683	The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
10684	Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .
10685	A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .
10686	I ca n't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .
10687	... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .
10688	Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
10689	One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .
10690	Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .
10691	The film 's most improbable feat ?
10692	It did n't go straight to video .
10693	... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
10694	The Chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .
10695	Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
10696	It 's not too fast and not too slow .
10697	It 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive .
10698	It 's not too much of anything .
10699	The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .
10700	About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .
10701	An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .
10702	We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .
10703	Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
10704	Whether Quitting will prove absorbing to American audiences is debatable .
10705	Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
10706	Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
10707	Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .
10708	Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .
10709	Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .
10710	Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .
10711	The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
10712	I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .
10713	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
10714	A Movie to Forget
10715	For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2Â 1\/2 - hour running time .
10716	Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .
10717	The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
10718	It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
10719	The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
10720	The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .
10721	Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .
10722	It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
10723	Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?
10724	The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .
10725	Tennessee Williams by way of Oprah 's Book Club .
10726	So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie .
10727	The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .
10728	Stale and clichÃ©d to a fault .
10729	This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .
10730	Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .
10731	The script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of ` hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for Spy Kids .
10732	Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner .
10733	Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .
10734	Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .
10735	Witless and utterly pointless .
10736	When ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
10737	Show me the mugging .
10738	Represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller\/horror genre .
10739	Visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .
10740	As a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
10741	A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .
10742	A sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .
10743	With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ?
10744	It 's just rather leaden and dull .
10745	Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .
10746	Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .
10747	Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .
10748	Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .
10749	De Ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter .
10750	Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .
10751	There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
10752	When one hears Harry Shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
10753	The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
10754	-LRB- Toback 's -RRB- fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to Wittgenstein and Kirkegaard ... blends uneasily with the titillating material .
10755	Adam Sandler 's 8 Crazy Nights is 75 wasted minutes of Sandler as the voice-over hero in Columbia Pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .
10756	essentially `` Fatal Attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .
10757	... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...
10758	Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
10759	The film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
10760	A singularly off-putting romantic comedy .
10761	This is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .
10762	It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow .
10763	I ca n't .
10764	In the spirit of the season , I assign one bright shining star to Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio -- but I guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
10765	Check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on .
10766	The movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like Chris Rock .
10767	A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story .
10768	A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is .
10769	The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .
10770	As self-aware movies go , Who is Cletis Tout ?
10771	is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .
10772	Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .
10773	... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .
10774	After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
10775	Director Jay Russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
10776	There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .
10777	Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
10778	At times , it actually hurts to watch .
10779	Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .
10780	The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
10781	-LRB- Tries -RRB- to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the United States .
10782	The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
10783	A beyond-lame satire , Teddy Bears ' Picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .
10784	I 've never seen -LRB- a remake -RRB- do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...
10785	Hollywood 's answer to an air ball .
10786	And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .
10787	Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
10788	A weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A. 's show-biz and media subcultures .
10789	But it does n't leave you with much .
10790	I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
10791	Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
10792	There is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie .
10793	Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .
10794	This is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
10795	There 's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... -LRB- b -RRB- ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .
10796	One of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way .
10797	From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
10798	Yet another genre exercise , Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title .
10799	Despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair ...
10800	There 's an admirable rigor to Jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down .
10801	Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .
10802	A lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles French , Japanese and Hollywood cultures .
10803	Such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .
10804	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .
10805	This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious .
10806	An ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
10807	Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
10808	A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
10809	So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
10810	A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip .
10811	Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon .
10812	This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .
10813	He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
10814	The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .
10815	It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
10816	In a strange way , Egoyan has done too much .
10817	He 's worked too hard on this movie .
10818	The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
10819	The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .
10820	A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ...
10821	The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichÃ©d and too often strains credulity .
10822	What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
10823	The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
10824	A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .
10825	To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
10826	This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
10827	It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
10828	Scotland , PA is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .
10829	A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .
10830	Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
10831	There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
10832	It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
10833	The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
10834	Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
10835	Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .
10836	Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .
10837	This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
10838	Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
10839	Weiss and Speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .
10840	Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
10841	Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
10842	The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
10843	Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
10844	It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
10845	It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
10846	Make Chan 's action sequences boring .
10847	You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
10848	` In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
10849	It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
10850	The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .
10851	The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
10852	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
10853	Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .
10854	Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
10855	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .
10856	Get out your pooper-scoopers .
10857	While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
10858	It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
10859	Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its Ã©lan , humor , bile , and irony .
10860	More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .
10861	There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .
10862	It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
10863	It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .
10864	The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !
10865	-- was a fad that had long since vanished .
10866	It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
10867	Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
10868	The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
10869	more precious than perspicacious
10870	If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
10871	-LRB- T -RRB- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .
10872	If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .
10873	Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .
10874	Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
10875	Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .
10876	Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
10877	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
10878	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
10879	Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .
10880	Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
10881	Nor is it a romantic comedy .
10882	Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .
10883	Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
10884	It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
10885	In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
10886	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
10887	The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
10888	Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
10889	It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
10890	Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
10891	Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .
10892	Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
10893	Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
10894	Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
10895	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .
10896	The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
10897	A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
10898	All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
10899	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
10900	There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
10901	The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , and the romance with Ryder is puzzling .
10902	Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .
10903	Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .
10904	Poor Ben Bratt could n't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .
10905	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
10906	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
10907	A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
10908	An empty , purposeless exercise .
10909	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .
10910	Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
10911	A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
10912	Those 24-and-unders looking for their own Caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
10913	A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .
10914	What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
10915	Ultimately , Jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .
10916	Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
10917	It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
10918	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
10919	When the precise nature of Matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .
10920	This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
10921	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .
10922	If you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea .
10923	A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
10924	The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
10925	This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
10926	A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .
10927	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
10928	The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
10929	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .
10930	A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
10931	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
10932	-LRB- It -RRB- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .
10933	Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
10934	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
10935	Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
10936	A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
10937	Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
10938	But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .
10939	Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
10940	It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
10941	Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .
10942	This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
10943	It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
10944	Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil
10945	The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
10946	Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
10947	Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
10948	Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
10949	Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '
10950	What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .
10951	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
10952	The movie is without intent .
10953	Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
10954	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
10955	If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is -LRB- Cattaneo -RRB- sophomore slump .
10956	Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
10957	Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
10958	You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .
10959	The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
10960	The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
10961	Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .
10962	Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
10963	It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .
10964	Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
10965	... feels as if -LRB- there 's -RRB- a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .
10966	Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
10967	He seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
10968	I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again .
10969	It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .
10970	Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .
10971	The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .
10972	The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
10973	No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
10974	Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
10975	A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .
10976	Bang !
10977	Zoom !
10978	It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .
10979	Lurid and less than lucid work .
10980	A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .
10981	At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less blab .
10982	If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .
10983	This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !
10984	True Hollywood Story .
10985	This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .
10986	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
10987	A porn film without the sex scenes .
10988	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
10989	A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
10990	Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .
10991	By the end , you just do n't care whether that cold-hearted snake Petrovich -LRB- that would be Reno -RRB- gets his comeuppance .
10992	Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !
10993	While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
10994	Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
10995	Yes they can swim , the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through .
10996	Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .
10997	Slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
10998	The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
10999	In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .
11000	For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .
11001	A thriller without a lot of thrills .
11002	This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
11003	Ah , the travails of metropolitan life !
11004	Alas , another breathless movie about same !
11005	In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
11006	Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .
11007	Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .
11008	Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
11009	Slap her - she 's not funny !
11010	No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
11011	Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
11012	`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''
11013	Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
11014	`` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''
11015	Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .
11016	One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
11017	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
11018	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
11019	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
11020	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
11021	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
11022	I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .
11023	An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
11024	Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !
11025	can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included
11026	Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
11027	It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
11028	In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .
11029	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
11030	Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
11031	Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .
11032	It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
11033	None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .
11034	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
11035	A great script brought down by lousy direction .
11036	Same guy with both hats .
11037	Big mistake .
11038	A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
11039	Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .
11040	He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .
11041	In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
11042	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .
11043	Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .
11044	According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
11045	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
11046	The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
11047	If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
11048	Fortunately , you still have that option .
11049	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
11050	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
11051	To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
11052	A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
11053	This u-boat does n't have a captain .
11054	With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
11055	This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
11056	Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
11057	I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
11058	Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .
11059	After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
11060	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
11061	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
11062	But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
11063	Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .
11064	As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
11065	... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
11066	Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .
11067	It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
11068	The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
11069	The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
11070	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
11071	Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
11072	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
11073	What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
11074	A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .
11075	little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
11076	The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .
11077	The Master of Disguise is awful .
11078	It 's Pauly Shore awful .
11079	Do n't say you were n't warned .
11080	Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .
11081	The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
11082	` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
11083	What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
11084	An ugly , revolting movie .
11085	The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
11086	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
11087	Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
11088	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
11089	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .
11090	It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
11091	The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
11092	From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
11093	My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
11094	A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .
11095	Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
11096	directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
11097	The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
11098	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
11099	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
11100	Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .
11101	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
11102	Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
11103	While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .
11104	The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .
11105	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
11106	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
11107	Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
11108	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
11109	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
11110	Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .
11111	The film is all over the place , really .
11112	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
11113	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
11114	The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
11115	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
11116	When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
11117	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
11118	Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
11119	While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
11120	Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
11121	Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
11122	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
11123	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
11124	The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
11125	The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
11126	Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
11127	The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
11128	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
11129	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
11130	It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
11131	All mood and no movie .
11132	Press the delete key .
11133	Simone is not a bad film .
11134	It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
11135	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
11136	... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
11137	Wait to see it then .
11138	There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
11139	Or for the year , for that matter .
11140	Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
11141	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
11142	Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
11143	Over and over again .
11144	The threat implied in the title PokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
11145	The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
11146	To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
11147	Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .
11148	The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
11149	By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
11150	Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .
11151	It 's not an easy one to review .
11152	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
11153	But it would be better to wait for the video .
11154	And a very rainy day .
11155	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
11156	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
11157	Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?
11158	Um , no. .
11159	But here 's a movie about it anyway .
11160	Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
11161	The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
11162	But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
11163	Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
11164	Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
11165	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
11166	But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
11167	A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
11168	Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
11169	Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
11170	It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
11171	Woody , what happened ?
11172	Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
11173	It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
11174	You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .
11175	Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
11176	Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
11177	Routine and rather silly .
11178	A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
11179	Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
11180	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
11181	Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
11182	While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
11183	Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
11184	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
11185	If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
11186	A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
11187	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
11188	On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
11189	The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
11190	More trifle than triumph .
11191	The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
11192	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
11193	Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
11194	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
11195	Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
11196	Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
11197	Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
11198	The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
11199	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' .
11200	Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
11201	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
11202	Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
11203	A well-acted , but one-note film .
11204	Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
11205	The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
11206	-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
11207	And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
11208	There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
11209	No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
11210	It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
11211	Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
11212	The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
11213	Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
11214	Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .
11215	The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
11216	We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
11217	Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
11218	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
11219	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
11220	When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
11221	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
11222	Marinated in clichÃ©s and mawkish dialogue .
11223	Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
11224	But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
11225	-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
11226	Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
11227	Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
11228	The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
11229	We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
11230	Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
11231	It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
11232	Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
11233	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
11234	Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
11235	Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
11236	With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
11237	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
11238	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
11239	When the violence actually shocked ?
11240	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
11241	Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
11242	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
11243	This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
11244	What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
11245	In other words , it 's badder than bad .
11246	If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
11247	A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
11248	A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
11249	Where the film falters is in its tone .
11250	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
11251	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
11252	It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
11253	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
11254	Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
11255	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
11256	An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
11257	A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
11258	A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
11259	It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
11260	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
11261	Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
11262	Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
11263	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
11264	It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichÃ©s the filmmakers could dredge up .
11265	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
11266	in period costume and with a bigger budget .
11267	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
11268	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
11269	It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
11270	A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
11271	A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
11272	If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and clichÃ© .
11273	Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
11274	This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
11275	Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
11276	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
11277	The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
11278	Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
11279	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
11280	Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
11281	Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .
11282	Hate it because it 's lousy .
11283	... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
11284	Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
11285	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
11286	Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
11287	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
11288	Not just unlikable .
11289	Disturbing .
11290	Disgusting .
11291	Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
11292	This thing is virtually unwatchable .
11293	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
11294	Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
11295	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
11296	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
11297	The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
11298	In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
11299	Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
11300	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
11301	The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
11302	A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
11303	The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
11304	Spy-vs .
11305	- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
11306	A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
11307	The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
11308	Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
11309	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
11310	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
11311	This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
11312	This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
11313	Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
11314	The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
11315	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .
11316	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
11317	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
11318	Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
11319	An extraordinarily silly thriller .
11320	A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
11321	Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
11322	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
11323	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
11324	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
11325	The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
11326	Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
11327	What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
11328	No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
11329	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
11330	The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
11331	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
11332	A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
11333	Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
11334	The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
11335	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
11336	This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of AmÃ©lie .
11337	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
11338	Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
11339	If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
11340	The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
11341	Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
11342	Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
11343	Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
11344	More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
11345	Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
11346	It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
11347	Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
11348	A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
11349	The drama discloses almost nothing .
11350	A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
11351	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
11352	As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
11353	A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
11354	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
11355	And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
11356	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
11357	It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
11358	It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
11359	The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
11360	But it does n't need Gangs of New York .
11361	Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
11362	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
11363	It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
11364	Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
11365	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
11366	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
11367	Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
11368	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
11369	Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
11370	It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
11371	Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
11372	... a rather bland affair .
11373	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
11374	The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
11375	I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .
11376	Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
11377	Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
11378	A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
11379	All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
11380	The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
11381	Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naÃ¯f 's encounter with the world .
11382	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
11383	It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
11384	I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
11385	If you go , pack your knitting needles .
11386	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
11387	We do n't even like their characters .
11388	Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
11389	The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
11390	It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
11391	This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
11392	Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
11393	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
11394	A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
11395	The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
11396	Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
11397	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
11398	Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
11399	Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
11400	Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
11401	Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
11402	The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
11403	You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
11404	I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
11405	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
11406	The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
11407	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
11408	an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
11409	- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
11410	A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
11411	An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
11412	... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
11413	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
11414	An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
11415	A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
11416	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
11417	Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
11418	A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
11419	-LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
11420	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
11421	Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
11422	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
11423	Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
11424	The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
11425	You have no affinity for most of the characters .
11426	Nothing about them is attractive .
11427	What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
11428	Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
11429	A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
11430	An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
11431	It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
11432	Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .
11433	Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
11434	Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
11435	No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
11436	You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
11437	` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
11438	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
11439	Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
11440	Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .
11441	Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
11442	How about surprising us by trying something new ?
11443	Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
11444	Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
11445	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
11446	Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
11447	You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
11448	The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
11449	This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
11450	A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
11451	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
11452	It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
11453	Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
11454	One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .
11455	Too bad none of it is funny .
11456	The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
11457	The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
11458	The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
11459	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
11460	Oh , and more entertaining , too .
11461	... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
11462	Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
11463	Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
11464	The film is strictly routine .
11465	Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
11466	While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
11467	In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
11468	It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
11469	The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
11470	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
11471	Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
11472	If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .
11473	We get the comedy we settle for .
11474	The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
11475	Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
11476	A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
11477	And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
11478	The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
11479	Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
11480	The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
11481	Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
11482	Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
11483	All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
11484	Hey Arnold !
11485	is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .
11486	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
11487	True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
11488	Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
11489	The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
11490	Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
11491	The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
11492	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
11493	It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
11494	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
11495	... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
11496	The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
11497	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
11498	In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
11499	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
11500	You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
11501	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
11502	This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
11503	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
11504	the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
11505	That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
11506	It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
11507	If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
11508	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
11509	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
11510	Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
11511	As pedestrian as they come .
11512	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
11513	It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
11514	Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
11515	More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
11516	An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
11517	The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
11518	As saccharine as it is disposable .
11519	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
11520	The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
11521	Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
11522	Too much power , not enough puff .
11523	The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
11524	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
11525	A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
11526	Muddled , trashy and incompetent
11527	For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
11528	Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
11529	Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
11530	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
11531	It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
11532	his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
11533	It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
11534	A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
11535	There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
11536	As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
11537	The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
11538	Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
11539	`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
11540	One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
11541	The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
11542	It 's a masterpiece .
11543	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
11544	They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
11545	And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
11546	Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
11547	Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
11548	A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
11549	By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
11550	Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
11551	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
11552	The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
11553	As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
11554	Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
11555	Catch it ... if you can !
11556	Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
11557	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
11558	` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
11559	It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
11560	Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
11561	The script is smart , not cloying .
11562	Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
11563	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
11564	One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
11565	An ambitious ` what if ? '
11566	that works .
11567	`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
11568	Nice piece of work .
11569	` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
11570	It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
11571	Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
11572	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
11573	From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
11574	Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
11575	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
11576	Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
11577	Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
11578	Go back to sleep .
11579	I did n't laugh .
11580	I did n't smile .
11581	I survived .
11582	The worst film of the year .
11583	In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
11584	A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .
11585	Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .
11586	Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .
11587	This is no `` Waterboy ! ''
11588	Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
11589	The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
11590	... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
11591	By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
11592	I ca n't recommend it .
11593	But it 's surprisingly harmless .
11594	What 's next ?
11595	The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?
11596	The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
11597	There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
11598	Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
11599	Absolutely not .
11600	It sucked .
11601	Would I see it again ?
11602	Please see previous answer .
11603	It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
11604	`` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat .
11605	A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
11606	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
11607	This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
11608	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
11609	If only it were , well , funnier .
11610	The script ?
11611	Please .
11612	Does n't add up to much .
11613	One of the worst movies of the year .
11614	A complete waste of time .
11615	Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .
11616	One of the worst movies of the year .
11617	... Watching it was painful .
11618	The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .
11619	Spiderman ROCKS
11620	A compelling coming-of-age drama about the arduous journey of a sensitive young girl through a series of foster homes and a fierce struggle to pull free from her dangerous and domineering mother 's hold over her .
