You know what I do is to write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you have read in the United States.
And I always tell the people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell in some place.
You just have to go around the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the year <unk> at the middle school, in Ohio -- where I was the rare of the class.
When I was just beating up every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me get into the bathroom of the teachers.
He did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and I ended up in San Francisco, and it ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never come to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I must tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand up with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We were going to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and we take care of their family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew what to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, he had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it was in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs -- needs dignity, and love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the water -- almost 60 meters, and I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> about another <unk> about a <unk> <unk>
<unk> are born when you get out of the glaciers or the ice booms are born.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to embrace and hold down to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated in and themselves, as much as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As a B15 iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't be going to exist in that way again.
It's not death when it was <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg which I photographed on <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually witness an iceberg <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved into the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg in Greenland, average size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each one -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much to the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about which, I don't pay attention to me.
Let's think about it for a moment.
And in this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm came together to the X <unk> X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X <unk> X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity to make two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people came to the anatomy of the anatomy -- you know, human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what they've thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins -- two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into male and conventional female experiences.
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopt many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in common forms or <unk>
For example, it's the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that will become <unk>
And then, in life -- the testes make testosterone.
But because this individual does lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's called <unk> <unk>
So, there are high testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops a <unk> course is <unk>
When I <unk> the baby is a little bit of a little girl.
It's a boy, it's raised as a little girl.
And often, it's not but until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And then from doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have in the body -- something called the areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The areolar <unk> produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the brain the more exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have <unk> <unk>
So sex is complicated -- it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> had <unk> and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a guy and I had just found out that he had room and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th trees and the uterus -- the <unk> areolar <unk> were so active that in essence, created a male environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born like <unk> no one <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, it was women in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th 20th develop is they develop what is known as <unk> -- you have <unk> tissue, wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are going to be -- twins or <unk> twins are <unk> <unk> or <unk> they are <unk> for a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they <unk> these surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, being black means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
Very simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very divergent ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children that are born like two people within one body.
The last recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> was put on judgment of judgment at the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to ask, "What are you going to do to determine whether or <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to say that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> we are the people who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we do the science, the more we have to say that these <unk> categories were categories like <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than we <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What do you find? Of them in just a few <unk>
And as we thrive in science, we get more and more on a very uncomfortable area in which we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone considers themselves dead.
Our ancestors never had to stand up with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of mine would put a pen in front of the nose, and if it was still moving it down.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma actually actually puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies but I have to admit that he gets a nervous.
And that these categories are much more fragile than we thought I was going to be <unk>
It was <unk> from the concept point of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so <unk> in what they did, that I find every bit of looking at that music, <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as they all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power of blood being passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game camp and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> -- that was very radical.
And partly as they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were being served two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and at the same time to look at science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were taken away from the explanations <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> a <unk> idea of the right of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at for example, the Declaration of Independence, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talked about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were passing the idea of the <unk> coincidence.
And in doing so, they were laid the foundation of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what about years next?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights Movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people who are going to go to the <unk> coincidence of <unk> and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow Movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention -- I want to keep some timber in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that to a human.
I don't mean we had to look at anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years were supposed to allow them to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that are <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, two months before time: June 1, 1980.
On the contrary, he was born in term: was born one of March March page.
For the only fact that we had been born three months before Mary were attributed all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the right for the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, by virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the author that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, for his hand, it doesn't have the rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can get married with a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science was moving so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy of <unk>
I don't want to give up in science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a moment has decided to get married with a man doesn't have to have a <unk> and to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests of people <unk>
But this is also very strange to given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Luther King, in his speech "I wish <unk> offers a solution.
It says we should judge people <unk> not in their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I should be able to focus on this for the rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to tell you that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent intelligent choices and <unk> about their sexual relationships than people from 40 to me.
So how do we put the issue of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI thing.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still leading this current <unk> of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian where a man feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to have a change of sex, where it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had done to sunlight twins to then pick it up, and so they <unk> her <unk>
But when the phone was asked by the phone of the operation, a very <unk> operation, he responded to me that other kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum. Instead of separation for <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change for the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to finish up, I mean, I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we had given more involvement in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> in particular, if there are people thinking in a group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sexual difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to engage in those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers that I knew I was interested in my feminism -- I thought to me as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what does women have <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female <unk>
But the more I have thought about their question, more than there is something <unk> in <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brains and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive -- they were very attentive to find the way to protect the people in the state, it's possible that, to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we give the democracy beyond the individual -- think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinking about where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents to do.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their low-cost cost.
So we could easily put it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they simply replaced by building buildings.
Imagine that half the people who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and the other half still <unk> to do that.
You could try to increase the capacity by doing it in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we're going to do is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the causes of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, build a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will be built, rather than building <unk>
So I suggested that governments are <unk> new reform zones to hold cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next few elections that we had to do -- <unk> <unk> were committed to a platform in which a reforms of reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing for a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, such as those rules that they say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need both of the technologies like the rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link to the TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They had me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, so much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, when he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain is a piece where it starts with <unk> ground and an option for people to choose if they want to go and not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> came to me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move it.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport just covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was going on at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The conference leader came up to the platform, and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away into the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would require <unk> countries that could benefit from the countries associated with that they would help them set up and make the rules of the <unk> so they could all trust the <unk> so they could all rely on that the <unk> are actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could take you a few thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, you voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional tool that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional for this constitutional constitutional
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 and over the other time was passed on in the other ways, of <unk> to one.
Immediately after voting on the time of 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after it was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing their Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new justice system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've solved you have solved is that they have a good number of people.
There's a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change it to another place.
There's a million a million a million dollars that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to go to work -- sometimes they are moms who have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are no kids who are trying to meet their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What seems to you to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently photograph and publish my blog and colorful and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people <unk> for the general thing -- my money goes to a good <unk> My look like <unk> and buying it into my personal search <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I'll like color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel I've won.
So back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
You're looking inside for a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets of data for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with a Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger man.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red phone.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself, and at the same time.
You just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people in the right person, not only do you get rid of you.
<unk> <unk> of the child who have been inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remember her little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> Trust is the key thing.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see anything, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and outside, there is no look that you can't do it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to do everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal <unk> and one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some things.
I don't need any emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy, colorful and brilliant suit -- if there is a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the wrong part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So, if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is completely intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physical physicists, we need a lot of logical logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is the one that says one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and didn't do it very well, he always <unk>
But I bet you play that bar in the parking bar to show him a valuable lesson, and it's that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particles, because they don't play in parking bars, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can walk across walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics -- a few years ago -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I should all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it doesn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand a little bit. It's found right at the center.
And then we do a very big approach to small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and that stands up on a platform.
And so I did this almost like you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward, it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator for me, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up with them to do those things, because I don't want them to hear it, or, really, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues on the journey of inanimate objects are not just the light that <unk> it, and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece of metal to behave on quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then we put a <unk> and pulled it out all the air, and then we put it at a temperature at less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, as being in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying still, it was <unk> and the way it was to <unk> it was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth station, we were able to make it <unk> and they didn't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing -- and they didn't go to the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down and down.
It's just on certain <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places, at the same time, what it means is that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was the shame <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom between one atom and that little metal piece is more or less the same than the difference between that little metal piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my sort of logical part of the logical thing.
So so imagine if they were in a number of places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you make your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we get it, and we turned the lights and we look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
So those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who's here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show you the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look at all the museums there.
Is the gallery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, the museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and, with one click, we jump inside.
You're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hall, right?
We keep going forward. That would be <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click on there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you actually do with 10 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his speech has no price.
But if you really want to do a <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And it was a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which consists of hitting a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And it would seem very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get into depth even further and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we go quickly to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and really get it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around around.
It's about <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery,
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all incredible things actually don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media will do justice to its work of art, and it's represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's all. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think this is a <unk> a flying pixel ...
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened to be something very interesting about corporate careers one in the last two decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I would take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, you get into real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're turning computers in the air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the purposes at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> uncle, <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans do with the outer environment.
In a certain sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end took the hammer, and he threw it over the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and said, "Nice <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they played in Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the River River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The timeline.
At the late afternoon, there are people over here and making phone calls, <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick phone call and goes into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big <unk>
The next day everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody drove down.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> time, people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and consume it.
We now know everything about the origin of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a <unk> how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in their shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to label what they were talking about, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all forms <unk>
Then we put them a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
There are complicated things, and there is a lot of need.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we just stopped not completely lost, that's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> a day still goes on there.
If we show it to people, then we can promote some behavioral change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell you a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of the water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop, it was, imagine you have a <unk> and put it out of <unk> valves just open and <unk>
It creates like a water curtain, with water.
If you go down the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can go to happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it so much.
And we had a commission to design the building at the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors and no windows, but when you open it up and it opens up so you can make it happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there is a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof goes down the roof, someone who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that it's <unk> but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
Here it is working.
You see the people who are going on the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that was going to open for you to leave you to leave you out, but a building that kept doing <unk> and water holes, and you had to jump to not getting wet.
<unk> noise) And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
So imagine you could have small helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
We could form this cloud, right?
A flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in the way that you can reach, and you can see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When you turn the lights on, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them with one person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, of the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance dancers of today, the star of the <unk> of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's both <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way around.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of you a little bit of a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've seen everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, from the power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or the emissions of CO2. How do you go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered <unk>
You can move around, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky like something that you can go up, like a <unk> <unk>
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but most important is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I would tell you that, with only a few changes in your genes, you could improve it for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What do you most of you know about it?
What would you do if you could choose something?
<unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do we love creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of us, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world is very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe that is possible?
Evolution has been a theme here at the TED conference -- but today I want to give you a doctor look at the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who was in addition to the <unk> Church -- wrote a trial in biology called "Nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or to us?
This is another look to the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at the end of the branch, is of course, the most interested.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
And in the intervening I've been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the basic meaning of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the little little bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when I Antonio <unk> it raises the <unk> think of the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pragmatic environment for those bacteria.
It's warm in the sky -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that can be able to have no effort in their part.
It's really like a fast thing for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some hasten <unk> toward the <unk>
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance like species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like a single <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first <unk> college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized that most fundamental thing in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell simply is divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when organisms appear to <unk> things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome is <unk> the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body will come in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death -- it looked pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door to hotel.
He opens the door.
And in front of him is a magnificent <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
He said, "It says George, chose the <unk>
I realized, as a physician, who was working for a different goal of the goal of the <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy <unk>
I wanted to regain health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to happen to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden into the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think that all of us, the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality for my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution didn't necessarily apply to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily apply to the greatest or stronger or faster or faster and even the more clever.
Evolution favors the <unk> creatures to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would argue if there were fish there, fish dry into empty, yet they have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what is happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look at the way back to the <unk> I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the evolution of evolution to happen.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a species, distant planets are going to exist in isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an effective, intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions that we want.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think of it as it could be possible if you could choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes are going to be more and more possible.
The Genome Genome Project, and he sued 13 years old.
<unk> billion dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three -- four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of good enough to make the human genome actually for <unk> and to be more and more and more and more of the everyone.
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren't only going to protect us themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine with the pandemic <unk> in cell plants.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
So imagine then only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, to eliminate <unk> reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes for preventing disease is going to allow us to have also to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could go to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices on a better society, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good thing or for worse, and before what these choices might be, they are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a seat that day -- I was sitting on the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So he immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You can probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Usually that's not the road.
Let's run the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words I have ever heard.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes,
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the fences that I wanted to get in, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that later. I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready, and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the way we <unk> the George Washington bridge, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also giving place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I think about things that didn't care with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to get rid of the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I am no longer trying to be right. It will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, 14, 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And while <unk> I had the feeling of, "I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness sadness is <unk> in one thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children <unk>
One month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- the first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- ...  And I scream, <unk> like a small guy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understand that two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you on your airplane -- and please not be like -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you going to do that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
So today, it has total paralysis,
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, is the graffiti thing that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second -- it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you get someone important and you have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Somebody at the film is <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they are making the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that sign a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was engaged with his brother and his father there at that very precise moment, "All right, well, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk about, and we're going to build a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inner inner can't be able to <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research -- which have a technology that enables them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that they draw over and record negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that are <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
You start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so I started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of organization and so much moving things on one side of the other we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that they could give them a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I speak to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bring seven programmers from all over the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage in the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they <unk> would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place that would have been <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the shipping ride. My son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk>
They are a pair of <unk> sunlight that we buy in the shipping ride of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- -- -- and you build one -- we <unk> we published the software -- the software is low at free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital that I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room in another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking wall outside of the hospital.
And he turned to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> by graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out there so that I could be able to <unk>
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up close to the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of Los Angeles in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibit called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of the things that there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I am not programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I simply recognized something, and I was excited about wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time a little dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of difficult and <unk>
And I spent 30 days to eat just -- a lot of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to examine social issues in ways that we would make a lot of interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that would be <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come out here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard it, or no, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights from the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea about what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you a year ago.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done to me for something so difficult or as dangerous as I go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to be the <unk> of products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with marketing and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything above the top at the bottom, it has images of brand, all the time; all the time; all the time from the title, which comes out before the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people are <unk> the film to <unk>
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
Was it <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure that we use all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you have <unk>
The most great car that you've driven on the largest film ever -- the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as a part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
<unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the full idea -- it all shot it, from beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> But I don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you will, it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One million and a half a million and a half a lot -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth <unk> to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to look at us as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
And so I thought, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to do it.
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of a microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have nothing to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the <unk> concept was to present the product to as much as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one.
Actually there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this picture is.
You see, when you look for <unk> images on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> <unk> that is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in practice, to be the last line perhaps the bigger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians have the <unk> the president -- even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really a lot changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that rare bear that still continues to <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
It was a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to be <unk> history.
We want it to be a story, but we want to get it <unk> story."
See, when I was a child, and my father would lie in some lie -- and that's there, he looked at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wants to help me -- and that just because John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take off the middle and go to the businesses myself.
So what I started to look at all of a sudden -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal issue.
MS: I have friends who make big films -- massive and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who do Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you get to you that <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> solid, to <unk> it on bar, like it.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
We put into the kind of smaller films that we have, we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind us to get to people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk>
Man: We talked about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category at positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep it so much more <unk> more <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What is a common guy.
I need to talk to the word of the street, the people like me, the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define you your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good thing.
Woman: revive the 1980s, the <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> one single <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like dark colors, many gray things like this.
Usually I take shots like <unk> or <unk> like crystals and so on.
Woman: If Dan was a brand -- it could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I mean, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Part of the hippie in part of the <unk> part -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the type of pets.
It took toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be made by Tom, but I would often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you get around you, your friends, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case in my case and they start in my family, in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like things different.
I like things, I like weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> Why do we do that?
What's the <unk> In what phase of <unk> are you now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
You know, little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be frightened. What kind of rollercoaster type are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but you put it in your personality personality -- the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was very well put together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to lie on one of their strong points or on the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that aren't <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them a little bit positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the Apple classic here.
And you can see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to take your identity, what would it be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
Are you conscious <unk> like <unk>
You are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, reliable, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they didn't have control, they would have not control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain that is so much for commercial marketing as a movies.
We went to San Paulo where advertising is forbidden in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are going to be making the way in schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've gotten more successful is those in which I have been doing with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They had it success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film came out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a two-year period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no television.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the rating agencies that we talked about would be part of their clients not going to be a part.
I've always believed that if you take an risks, if you take risks that you have opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing into failure.
I think that when you train your employees in <unk> it's preparing their whole company for a <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Today, more than never a bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been presented for my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket -- I have a check at the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my <unk> for next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that are able to control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is completely different technology.
But if we have to put a cash virus out of Windows in a laptop that was used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to investigate about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> <unk> using multiple <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
And that struck us, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very strange.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is effectively working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we say, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the <unk> code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and big one.
We also found that they were armed very professionally by people that obviously had the entire internal information.
We would have all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it would be the operator.
So they know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this <unk> code.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It's pretty much like old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at initially was calls to the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about what we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's probably in Iran because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find a lot of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the engineers of <unk> so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
<unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
It wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been among several weeks of hard work.
We had <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to begin again.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would be used to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> for <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
That's the orange box -- and you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of the sensors for example, for the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding a video <unk>
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the middle of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big water turbine goes down, you have to open valves in a <unk>
Obviously this can't do this a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither is the <unk> no security system <unk>
It scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see specifically, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk> factory plant.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> that we disseminate this burden with a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional <unk> technology.
It was the most possible.
And if you made that, what do you do with is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we're starting to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There is one itself, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you a <unk> or another one that makes users of wheelchair raise raise and go back and go back.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets into the morning, it gives you a great force that is also increasing its speed, and helps it for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back to a 45 pounds, and it's going to be <unk> carrying even more equipment.
Obviously this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton to <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds for content for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk> movement.
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then my strength increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So now I look at users of the wheelchair, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that are being added very rapidly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who's 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
Not <unk> on crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the motors on the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move through this very soft and very natural.
AB: I had 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, skiing down down it was <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk> down.
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it to the last hint of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride on <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the chairs of the wheels, all of the <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just went back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not <unk> Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in Congo.
The Bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living parents.
That means that we all share a common ancestry.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done very much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by the big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence hasn't been <unk>
But sadly, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been given for decades and caused almost deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger of the Bonobo.
The meat trade trade and deforestation, make you can't fill and a stadium with the Bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to deal with conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
At <unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a <unk>
For us, and for them, the game is fundamental to set bonds and encourage <unk>
With him learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobos Bonobos see the roots of the <unk> the same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual of it.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a few unique videos of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You have <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves her, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common both in Bonobos as humans.
And this video really is interesting because it turns out this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to come up with this is <unk> a young female -- who is playing with the water <unk>
I think that, as it sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a more and harder world that we have to adapt to a greater and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
In order to adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get it at the maximum our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
<unk> is critical.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at least right at least play, you can be the moments that it's the most <unk>
So colleagues are primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, they were <unk> as a captain of captain in a fire of firemen volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are <unk> a highly skilled <unk> you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of it.
But still, there was a career standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing out in the rain, he was standing out in the rain, under a <unk> on his <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he came first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money, which for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a burning building to save a live alive just because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to be <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise you I do assure you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the corridor went to the firemen <unk> that at that height or less had ended up on the fire and entered the fourth main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
We bring the house from the house for the owner of the house, where, as it was to expect, their treasure.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave talented effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a volunteer and <unk> of acts of the generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also about acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have made, or are they -- remarkable levels of success would like to remind you this: not hold on.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
We were eating food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
You're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first building blocks became built in <unk> with a very simple idea, concrete modules of a fixed measure that fit in each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called the brick of assembly itself.
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings, or homes.
It made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small piece of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> stacked to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there is a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for an expert one.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they put together through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
<unk> have a code in color.
The green is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange of the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
<unk> blue with one green is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a <unk> <unk> that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, they are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to connect and <unk> and <unk> <unk> lets us program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow, just to make it faster or <unk> just this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection of it.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> bricks to use.
You know, sounds like, sound, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is being open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought back to design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see it with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island designers who don't have any experience in engineering, only in wood wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an canyon of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has a fear of darkness.
For these not the engineers, the <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to get involved with the environment focused on.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better and leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, you know, I was <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had a few members and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of getting it to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the chances of the current technology.
Do you meet <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I went to a date, but what it really looks for is that somebody is caught up in the snow because he knows that it's not very good by turning fires out of a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time -- very much last year.
They realized that the city was never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can embrace a <unk>
You embrace <unk> when you <unk>
By doing that, you put a name, in this case he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a playground.
It's a modest app.
It's probably the youngest of the 21 applications of the last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It spreads <unk>
It's responsible for the city of the city of <unk> to see this application realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for citizens to embrace the tsunami.
It's very important to work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just took launch it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use using it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal channels that would have taken at least two million years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the judicial power of California that at the moment 2,000 billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that takes program in a couple of days and it spreads into viral form, is a kind of warning.
It suggests to the world's best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, like a lot of people think that should be.
Not like a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the form open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem with an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to engage together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
You haven't given the government.
They have a huge frustration before that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it alone doesn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics isn't <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately made us -- you remember that <unk> the <unk> The way to think about it will affect the way to produce the way of change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the <unk> center of services and information.
It's the place that serves calls if you mark 311 in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the foundation of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything, started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open the gates of the house, put it hard and see if you get <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a phone center.
It has a call and a mobile app called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking to a person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you can all see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the income in the government of the government to <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, they <unk> the communities.
If we call the animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people will get it, but it thinks you're the entrance to the other.
What our entry to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a leader leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government to <unk> our values and it liked our needs, but then we don't see it.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> surface layer of it.
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> that keeps us that that belongs to us that we funded as something that works in our against, that other thing and a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we need to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of governance.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform system.
That's not political activism it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that have been <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go without solving the institution that can act on the name of all?
We can't do with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not as hard to act -- just to be able to act -- only to be able to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is a 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a generation more than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that much for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions on any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem not much to make you hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They set their hands to the work for programming applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a <unk> by taking off <unk> dumping a bucket of junk that has an <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like <unk> digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only the government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the citizen to <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we also have a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that have been in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And to be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we saw fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling special meaning they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, he had power.
It was the last word in every single discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way it looked like the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little and I looked at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so hard I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and she said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back again and if I told him I know, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that I would always do would wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and I smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, I went through the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. We are two to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know it, I said, "Sure."
Then she sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you like."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "Well, the first thing I want you to do is that you always want your mother."
I said, "She's not my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do it."
Then he said, "Well, the second thing I want you to do is that you always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I'll do it."
And then finally he said, "Well the third thing I want you to do, is that I never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in <unk> I have a younger brother a year and a younger year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> caught us and I took my sister and I went to the forest.
We just reach out by doing the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You're okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I mean, you know? And you always do the same thing.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I landed the eyes with a force and <unk> "Ah, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to say something about you.
I'll tell you something that's probably not supposed to say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that he has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't see it.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe you can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we did with it, we need to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black communities, it finds so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black holes between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or a parole.
In urban <unk> in the entire country, Los Philadelphia, Los Philadelphia, Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better and <unk> than if you're poor, and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these aren't problems.
We're satisfied.
I think that's interesting.
We're looking at our work in some of the things well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, this is like in other states, <unk> rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black males have lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world that was sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility to go out ever.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
People in death row.
This business of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for competitive crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by mistake.
Of each nine people have identified one that is innocent and liberated from death row.
An <unk> rate, an innocent innocent rate.
This is interesting.
And in aviation wouldn't allow you to ever fly planes if every nine that you had, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this thing if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I talk about slavery.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, you ask me -- you teaches talks, you give people to stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously <unk> and decades of <unk> race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we would have to do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs me work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that couldn't be overcome <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death row.
It was fascinating, because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know it's good disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "There is no death death in Germany.
We will never be it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way in our history, we could never get to a systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> would put us to the people."
So let's get it about this.
How do we focus on a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not have it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things that positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
We talked about the need for more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
With innovation, development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are made by the heart of the heart.
This connection to the mind is what drives us to do not only in the bright and <unk> but also in dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we looked at all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that guidance for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I believe that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allowed us to be really human if we don't pay for the due to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make it a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered together to talk.
Occasionally, I was called <unk> to me, <unk> comes the <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
And so I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion was there, I was listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> give me a question that is that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help the ones that have been <unk> <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without free freedom for the kids.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it was <unk> exhausted, exhausted, rather <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> he threw my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with these challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced if someone says a lie, is not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
So it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very exhilarating, we don't know about our technology, for our design -- not for our intellectual and rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat the powerful rich, but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand real issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years, that have been <unk> for them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't it?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night I was very late I was awake for God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't say you must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer a little <unk> <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated as a privileged white <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I found there had been a behavioral behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, it wasn't just the <unk> but he had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to cut this case, stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car.
I was going down the stairs when I found a black man, he was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I went up and got me up.
And I was <unk> on the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud to <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
I connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge saw me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Sir, I went me." And we started again."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They got the cops the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, I know how the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
You look at the window, and you would try to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black kid was in the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge is a <unk>
During the rest of the <unk> he showed <unk> because <unk> had come in the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black man."
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black foot stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this guy in audiences to tell this young woman to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds up toward justice.
We cannot really be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
What our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see an obvious wish to the audience, in this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities for you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be a <unk> effort for the funding that you spend today in business policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of homicide cases, not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes come to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make it the law of security.
I think there is a very humble opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to you who believe it is?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes in violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
So this is why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us by the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain, by stealing a bicycle for small crimes against property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy on punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that is the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you excited about <unk>
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> threats for Bin Laden's deaths.
<unk> two: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police sends gas.
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> right, 65 dead.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Olympic tsunami.
Several <unk> War, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Egypt.
<unk> Death.
Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. It would be in the last six months.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early Olympics, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So this is why we have a <unk> of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all the digital devices give us news news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe not that way.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress that has done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, water <unk> water and <unk> no doubt of it.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the very long, we just ended up with them.
Let's take it on the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> per capita income per capita per capita has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food food, of transit and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles important that the world literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to make expectations more and higher expectations at all.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, toilets, TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would have never been dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is technology and, lately, exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that was going on in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the price of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So why the mobile phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in the war and peace, in the recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the <unk> of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate is at least faster and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count.
And the computation in the cloud, my friends of <unk> call sensors and <unk> and networks, and 3D output and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the malaria and the food, the <unk> the digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that I was doing.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can impact the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to make life <unk> for every single <unk> is about creating a life of as possible.
It's about taking that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, dearth is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a <unk> story in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> ate with <unk> silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the <unk> king ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most precious metal of the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
So for that reason, the tip of <unk> to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then it came the <unk> and he did the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
Let's give this analogy to the future.
Think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that we would have for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about need, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the age of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, it will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy too, we have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the spacecraft spacecraft called the Earth, in 1990, after it was <unk>
<unk> a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet planet.
We live on a planet in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, water is ice, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to give you your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small fridge in the size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any single source -- saltwater, water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just convinced me that it will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola will implement the world in <unk> countries.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than the president Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted ever.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, libraries of books and music, diagnostic technology, now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device that they talk, and because they have <unk> they can be <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a <unk> team.
So imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the payload <unk> is 25 percent, and there are <unk> from health workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that didn't want to call the health care and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we will spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion of our minds never before we have to add to the global conversation.
What do these people?
What do you say? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health than the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D, and to computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about a voices that are never before the <unk>
What if we give them to <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What do these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we cannot <unk>
One thing I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams guided by their passion with a goal of course, you can do things -- things that were previously able to make the big companies and governments.
I'm going to finish up with a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and <unk>
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with college professors among each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be taught to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades of extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that I pursued <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually pick up fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
It caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water's surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 percent, the <unk> of the black card.
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was happening for a good moment, so it was taken over the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had gone down in half.
I was going to go to the five inches.
We <unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the drag fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- called the <unk> <unk>
And I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in southern China -- and in the South China -- and, above all, in the Aral Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
I know now what the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are kind of <unk> tiny remains about <unk> remains of coral reef.
In short, the sea bottom came across the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom is going to be a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of debris is what they collect every time they go to an area that they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember it.
It was going to be the start of the start of the beginning, the new level, not remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
And on the axis, we have things -- biodiversity, quantity of killer <unk> the water supply happened, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation of <unk> images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
So you can look at the printing of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that, in a big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were gone.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very prevalent before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animal animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big, and in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
With time you have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence was presented in a <unk> way that they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them is that some of them as captain such as captain so many fish in this area cannot be used or generally they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous paper that can be able to make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine areas we actually do recreating the past.
You know, the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been done, and it's very low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we want, which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do that because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the void.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were very touched by the movie -- to talk about the story of <unk> why would we get <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is <unk> to <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I am Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional video.
It's true.
So we're going to see what the videos are <unk> and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper to a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous in the Internet in a <unk>
You go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, just a little percentage does viral ago, gets lots and lots and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot outside his house at the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of popularity of the past summer.
He was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
There was a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> I published this <unk> to <unk> the video to the <unk>
The subjects of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's on a Friday.   You all want to start on the Friday.   You all want to get on the Friday.                     -- a Friday.                    
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, on Friday <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a bunch of creators embrace a view of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great joke internal joke then it starts to talk about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 pounds of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a dominated animation, with a <unk> music.
That's the thing.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three million hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the ancient one.
And then it became international himself.
All of a sudden, a whole community came out of a community, that made this to happen to be a dumb joke at something that we all can form a part.
Because today not only do you hear it?
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could be predicted by <unk>  <unk> or Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What's wrong with you might have written this situation?
In a world in which you go up two days of video per minute, only that truly unique and unexpected can be able to make it so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I am <unk> for the <unk> but we often have obstacles that keep you in properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and its humor, Casey <unk> did that five million you saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole thing that we do in a creative way.
And all this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend -- creative communities of participation, all the unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just the current media characteristics -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> in the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so much time, friends, now with it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to, but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is on a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> <unk> escape and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do that.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat is wrapped up into the sea <unk> <unk>
All the adults know the risks.
The greatest fear of <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother carried a <unk> with poison.
If we were going to let me first take you my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every <unk> and the average horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights of the oil platform, front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, he <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class, whose population is comprised of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments were <unk> among the people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title at IT and get a degree on IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and it was established an extra <unk> in English and math -- no matter what was supposed to be <unk> which was generally <unk> was always <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform for the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would get rid of our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> every boat.
And my task was to be up until his nightmares started to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do angry and angry and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> <unk> with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in life <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drug and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of waiting, I was elected by the Australian <unk>
And I went out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges, not <unk>
So <unk> resident <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in places I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life at a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters at the day as they did for about 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she gets into the boat.
He hasn't ever been an option.
<unk> he said, "What don't you be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly, the more I talked about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, so many of them doing what they would do, living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a little bit of the scene -- and not only it's something that is something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave these enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> <unk>
There was a energy there, a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
And they went to a small group of people for the people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of each day, it was a giant <unk> <unk>
They were going to get to entry at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant and we open up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
And after one trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later there was <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, I caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she did, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower room in the room at <unk> when she was killed, 1,000 kilometers, in <unk>
I looked across the <unk> of the shower and I saw the other side stop.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called me later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there is a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could do that for you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the right thing.
Can I give you a <unk> in your life, a brave steady rate in each <unk> the <unk> rate steady of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today, on the fourth or a fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians want to travel to a chariot and we would have the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great prince of Indian warrior had <unk> he pulled a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And I was very excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I gave myself this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to do not <unk>
As a child my grandfather gave me his silver <unk>
And this kind of <unk> technology was for me the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the cameras stop and the cameras prevent them.
We will have our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up with this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a device to connect readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that matter?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
It says, "You know, your fingers on every light."
And so --  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
At a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner child gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but the magic of the childhood, those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me very exciting.
So over here, we have to break the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what it looks like in the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy, in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is turned into a <unk> that I would <unk> to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all fantasy book there is always been maps but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain dots of the book they also get <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another incredibly important thing to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and wet book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's story.
It is in a story which is the current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this entire childhood ritual to go out and, in a <unk> <unk> a photo to a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so it creates a digital collection of pictures that can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a photo of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between the magic and the Earth and technology is so many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on, and it turns out and by augmented reality you see a <unk> group that appear on the inner plants.
At one point the screen is full of leaves it.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world in which the forces of nature are focused on technology, and the magic and the technology and the technology gets closer to another.
We <unk> the power of the sun.
We're moving into our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic world and love and love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to the patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What happens?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I was a challenge to reach 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I'm going, it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when he needs to get care of it, or some urgency of that style -- but it sees it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 3,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure for the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity to be more control of their health.
From the week next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take care of their houses, take their blood pressure, their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to regain the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care for health care because of the challenges that we face, like the behavioral care costs -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video.
We all have controls navigation at <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where machines are in <unk>
What is all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves life right now.
So what we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a web website, and we asked the public audience -- you see a <unk> for favor for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes they open up in the office and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else is <unk> you can use your iPhone, and for the next few weeks to use your cell phone in Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to take a global level.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find them and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you go on a holiday and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies across the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You could be services or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was awakened to my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera and the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
So let's look at it like this: an building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful to the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way like photography.
You know, you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that we can capture a moment.
But what is the trick that does it look real like this.
They're the details or <unk>
Would you get light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end of it is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined it can be able to create something that still looks like <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that really doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really <unk> different realities.
And the things that make a photo looks like realistic I think they are those in the ones that don't even get the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs is very important, because otherwise something else is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are combined to have the same type of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that is easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that has on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing.
<unk> are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made red the house at the top of the island to it as it looks like more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please do if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors versus the power of the local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on the <unk>
In other words, each step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here is something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights on.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we see <unk> curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw the drawing on a normal curve, where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, another technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it turns out a <unk>
If the technology of <unk> <unk> as fast as the last morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is not <unk> in the history of technological development of growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's give it one of two things.
Or it will be turned into a <unk> <unk> I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we will now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way to adopt the world?
What new state is going.
The transition is very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
It turns out a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back to about two billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals that <unk> around them.
If we look at the way these chemicals organized it to us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there's theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that's that, at the time, there was some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring from the outside of the outside and the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the more mobile forms of cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it was <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every droplet was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow it would be better at the time of bringing the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly, they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple, but things are going to be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this clip of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years old.
But then another big step occurred in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, it evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are so resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, were together in it, and a <unk>
<unk> or <unk> together, or so if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community, they get more and they were overwhelmed by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came to the time that they actually came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community of a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage we have communities that have communities, communities of many different kinds of different cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The cell in the skin is no without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process information in community.
They are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those individual cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary <unk>
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit, because she knew bad and sick last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these kinds of information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of the individuals who ate that fruit of the men.
So the fact that the nervous system build those structures of information enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated to make it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That is now allowing us to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we started doing abstractions.
Now we go through periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> computer tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen at <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that told you for a billion years every single one.
The next stages the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The following, the language etc., they took less than a million years.
And magazine, like electronics, it seems like just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes it.
And I think that's what we observed in this <unk>
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor does in that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers. We think a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you can't ever get, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method, that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please <unk> you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences at random, running all those programs, and take those programs, and take those of the things that are <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to make a numbers, just to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to some of the <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But once it was able to find out two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best to ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children -- that <unk> <unk> and that children will take the properties of both programs.
And so we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's get back again.
They were <unk> some mutations there.
And it tries to make it new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or rather complicated, within hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that will be absolutely perfect.
In fact, it's much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test it to see how they work.
They're very strange programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security of the goal because they come from a lineage from hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing that.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can run these programs much faster.
Or is it <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
Are we <unk>
And we are at an analog moment of <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We're the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our understanding that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a physician, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give me a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, this is approaching the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know about it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of the <unk> to <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to launch it at the first base -- not to come back, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts for 10.
You know what they call a <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> <unk> in running more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now I'm going to show you this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable -- or maybe less awkward, than I will tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also a <unk> record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a <unk> <unk> has two <unk> <unk> and their family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's a big improving this year.
And your hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask you.
What do you think of you that must be the average of a heart surgeon or a <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a nice doctor or a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I would feel like me with the <unk> of being perfect.
They never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied until a blood <unk>
Like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nursing residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
In my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> differential diagnosis and not standard.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And I went out of the school school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then it would know everything, or as possible, close to everything else, because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met the <unk> lady.
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the emergency lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested a cardiologist to go to that patient to go to that patient.
And it comes to the chief of residents and <unk>
When I saw the <unk> lady, I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what it gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I read it.
I gave aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that he could eliminate liquid.
And at an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more errors.
I sent her home without talking to the chief of residents with me.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my chief and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring out information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to pay attention to you.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
As they sent it home, I didn't recognize a voice to a voice on my inner self that said, <unk> it's not a good idea. You don't have it.
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse I was interested in the <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse I thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the tall, and the ambulance along with the ambulance and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I was going to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't do normally, as usual.
I went through the emergency care service of the way home.
And there was another nurse, not that I was talking about the old lady before, but another three words, those three words that most emergency emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear it too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see patients <unk>
The three words is: does it remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour I had come to his house, after I was a high collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure that means a severe severe.
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff is <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for every hope that he was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that he never danced.
He had a permanent <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was going on.
And by the ninth day, he was left to go. "The wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is what I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would take the things and make sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why was he sent to his house?
And in my worst <unk> Why made it made such a <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to raise the efforts to be perfect for not making any more errors, I would let those voices.
And it did.
I came back to work again.
But it came back again.
Two years later, I was an emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
She took him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran the door on the door he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my shift change, my head asked to speak to me in your office.
And I gave the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition. called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, it's an infection, but it can cause the closing side of those tracks.
He literally didn't die.
You were going to get antibiotics for <unk> and they recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and over and over again.
Two times in the same change in the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was going to be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation on it.
It was an X-ray shot, but it turned normal. A colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was very diarrhea.
I read the liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
I went through it, and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner called the surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't come to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> to tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure.
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own errors.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well as a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- believe it would have hard to look at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of errors.
It's the system in which there are two sets of mistakes that they make mistakes and those who don't sleep and the ones that I know; those who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we go from medicine to people who make mistakes that will be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical memory and mistakes to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or the <unk> is not correct.
In this country, a thousand Canadian people die in the <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so that's what things are.
A self-organizing system, where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get rid of us.
<unk> <unk>
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> to contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, not to stay anybody.
And with me that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white <unk> it's a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone toward them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> their head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> doctor is human, you know, the human, they accept it, and they are not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It supports their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
Do the mistakes of other people not with intent -- but in a loving way and support and support for all of them to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes from time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, let's make mistakes.
And I feel very much but effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that she says to pick a average American, are about 70 a day.
Not a lot of a long ago in a research followed by a week to a group of business presidents ...
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are inspired by these executives and the time that we need to make decisions related to those assignments.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> works for week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
You know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you figure the way that we're managing those decisions?
I want to talk to you today about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choosing to the options of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to give you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In the other way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and some 25 water <unk> and this was when you take water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion asked me, why never I buy nothing?
This is the oil shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided I went to the manager and asked him, well, this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists which came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different classes.
It was a post to <unk> right to the store.
We put it out there <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First of all, in which case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had taken a hundred than when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy an jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was only 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, they had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six times more likely to buy them.
Well, they decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have <unk> less is good to preserve <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choices is affecting us very hard decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement to a million Americans, from a few of a million Americans, of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of choices available to support plans for retirement, for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of <unk> funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that give you two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when we have more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more it was the number of choices, more people are going to be paid to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as we had more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the earlier decade we've seen three main negative consequences to deliver more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we would make the decision, that the <unk> even though it goes against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worse <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it would go better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that wide variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choosing that awesome <unk>
Today, I want to introduce you to four simple techniques that we have, in a form or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You have heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which has ever been more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decides to cut, get rid of odd options, odd options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> costs will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> for 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation were <unk> <unk> eliminated the products of cats that less <unk> are increased by <unk> in <unk> for two older sales and lower costs.
You know the supermarkets, on the average today, give 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store. It's about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce.
In the world of the financial savings I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, are giving them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer people in this audience a lot of paid to the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to give you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second, but I can tell you what they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> of the choices that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
It doesn't seem like real money.
It turns out that it would be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get them more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> a <unk> plan.
A meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> made a little <unk>
What we added was that we asked the staff to think about the positive things that they would believe in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the magazine show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to be <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you have a <unk>
<unk> Well, there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> you have a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> but you know anything?
This <unk> scheme is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something about the <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of fundraising.
Who are you going to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just have a little bit more <unk>
We need to increase the costly complexity up.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision about the purchase of a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that enables <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> color in the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions come in.
So half of the clients are going to go in many choices, 56 colors, to a few examples, four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go in a few options, four <unk> over 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about you are.
If you go down, you always have the <unk> button on every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are going to have a lot of choices to give you the default button and again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same kind of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although you pick the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of <unk> <unk> to get rid of alternative alternatives -- <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories of less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about it.
And the more careful we are in our choices to be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in East Germany in East Germany -- if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
You had to record a piece of text from written by the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they were written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think somebody could do this, how much it could do this, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow printed on every page that follows a pattern that makes them and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the net.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through <unk> banking to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our card when we buy them on a <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> of this guy, Sam <unk> and this tells you had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to get worse.
In the future, most of the crimes are going to happen.
The second group of bombers in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate them for laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role on the online attacks.
Those are the three main bombers that criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national United States that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack, against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall fall because of a <unk>
You know, the security of the site and causing a <unk>
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders to be able to <unk> the death of people from the heart attack.
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do you do <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services <unk> services like <unk>
Except <unk> an authority foreign authority.
And they would give up <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the headquarters for the Egyptian police police in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was some notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, tools for <unk> the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So the Western government -- the Western government, provide tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western government, also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to find their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
You get the Internet connection.
It was even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the argument online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do with it.
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's <unk>
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trusting our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the south part of the National Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cows, the Nairobi.
The National Park, the National Park has nothing in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead and I found it dead because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were dying of people who protect our community and livestock and also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park, of Nairobi.
A child in my community, in the age of nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that I thought to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that it didn't really exist, because it was even helping the lions to see the <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to cheat lions so they believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So we jumped and killed and die.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn on and turn up the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk> <unk>
They put it all.
As you can see, the solar cell load up the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give up because that's where lions.
And this is what lions see it when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood have heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals on lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven homes in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and also being used to scare elephants for them.
I was fortunate to get a grant on one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights on the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid on the meadows of the <unk> <unk> my father, and he used to see flying airplanes, and I used to see it one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to come to be a aviation engineer, and a pilot when I <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you have invented <unk> but I want to make my own.
CA: You know, I'm going to do this one time, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk>
We go to <unk> at every step that I love my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up and raised a song called "Not <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Africa, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed in North Korea.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And that said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I walked in front of the train, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the streets, holding a kid in his arms looking at his face without being able to do anything.
No one was <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine will have left North Korea in the <unk>
At the end, more than a million North Koreans died during hunger, and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
It also became more and more frequent <unk> everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a North North Korean photograph in the night compared to the individual countries.
This is the <unk> River that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans across <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, it saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left from North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of starvation I went sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee dollars.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to finish up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking asylum.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
I was lucky to escape a lot of other North Koreans not so much luck.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and find work, everybody can be able to get it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided to monitor it going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a huge challenge of what I expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was not a country that I could call with pride of me.
Although the life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and, like blame, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China, and I went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow, for over three miles across China, and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by an official police officer.
And he asked the identification of everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border border,
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned for crossing the border illegally.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything for my family and we were so close to my family, and we were so close -- but my family was <unk> in prison.
And I was going to come in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family to my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind was <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the town to get it to the village -- when I was <unk>
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the <unk> that the <unk> people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language language, practice jobs, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Africa.
This is Center for <unk> stores -- fast food, terrain <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought, let's change the name of South Pole to represent something else, so they changed to Los Angeles and South Los Angeles as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles and the Los Angeles --  -- <unk> -- fast food, terrain <unk>
Like <unk> millions of other Americans, living in a desert. So Los Angeles Center, home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
What's funny is that the places of food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize that will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects, that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as a car <unk>
I look at <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of managing a 45 minutes of back and turned around to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet x of three me.
The point is, belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me at <unk> because it is my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we get together, and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, <unk> <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of a paid group of <unk> made up of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the yard, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets sick.
The city on me over and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A <unk> order of plant food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had been written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
The L.A. city is the city of the United States with more ground.
It's <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million tomato plants.
Why does the Earth do not seem like this?
We have a plant to give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Africa.
I grew up there, I grew up with my kids there.
I was excited to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I farming my art.
Like an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, I would be <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You were going to see what the Earth can do. If they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witness how my garden became a education tool that became a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
It was <unk> to see how they affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that can be done, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my yard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, man, man, I felt bad -- and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Well, no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's what it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how it had affected it, and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant -- maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, and they work and put them all in a volunteer.
If kids grow up, the boys will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they eat <unk>  But if none of this are <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I look at young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see the color of color that are at this way designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who were going to train these boys to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to carry containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't get paid.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, getting the kids out the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Would you take them to take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, don't be called me if you want to sit on the comfortable chairs and have a meeting to talk to you about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace <unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very <unk> road.
It's made out of tarmac, and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, as it rains so much.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt to <unk>
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you would want a silent road.
The solution to that is to do asphalt roads.
<unk> asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so the water can go through it, so the water is going to flow through the sides and you will have a road, which is easy to drive, and not waste water, never more.
Noise also disappear.
Because it's <unk> all the noise to disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can be <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road, the rocks of the surface is <unk>
And first a stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> well, don't do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> She's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how damage in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so you just have a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> and the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool of steel -- that to clean <unk> and we can cut out the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
And so we have asphalt with small bits of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use it for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heating the steel -- melt the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
And I used to have a <unk> oven because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a <unk> of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take lots of samples of this road, and we test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden into them, and then they have a <unk> machine, and we looked at it, and we turned it back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, and you can even double the life of the surface of the surface, and they can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool the first before I can show you what works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC to his little gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school."
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban was <unk> in Afghanistan, and they were illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could do it.
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where they <unk>
We had to hide books on market bags so it looks like we were shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our <unk> the teacher, students and our parents.
Every time, the school was <unk> suddenly for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to come from?
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. And in Afghanistan. And his daughter, my mother went out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my polite mother became a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks of risk.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate their children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life, and he was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can help leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So you still want to be <unk>
I've been 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one that was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who took him driving around the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I have a big dream, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
It's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the hard desire for leveraging the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families, which, like mine, <unk> for them, even though it was even in front of a <unk> opposition.
As a <unk> It's not his name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students' students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to your house, the phone is the phone, a voice would notice that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would go to try.
<unk> already, if he said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old child and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, in Afghanistan, and it's something which is often in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often they are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks as different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And I'm afraid that these changes didn't last long, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who are paying for them, I see a <unk> future, and a lasting lasting future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution came inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like the <unk> revolution.
A forces with a lot of other citizen citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were at the middle, the fall of the regime, they collect freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown the courage to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a number of losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of <unk> society.
<unk> of the devastation and in the challenges, I am dear to a lot of other women, rebuilding civil society, <unk> a demographic transition and just toward democracy and national piracy.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> roughly 300 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I came back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of women founded <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very pragmatic orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right involvement in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> of selfish and domination policies.
Over time, our initiative was saved and successful.
The women won a <unk> from the National Congress in 52 years.
But recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution like a whole, were <unk> every day we were <unk> in violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and its <unk> human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made a <unk> mentality, and it's removed from the ideals and early freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The <unk> and the <unk> became the icons of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all with the <unk> of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm right here today to confess that we, as nation, we chose worse, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation and <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies and domination, both for men like <unk>
Maybe what was missing wasn't just women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than we needed the elections, which is only <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of how women need to be <unk> and <unk> it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call it a few days of anger.
We need to begin to act like compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also putting it into practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration in place of competition, the <unk> instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, desperately needs to reach the peace of getting peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that tries about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and male perspectives.
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> women and <unk> that spans the humanity of the men and women, where all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows up inside, the divine array of compassion is going to take it all of existence.
So it says, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
So it says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They're all given to them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a naive question, which has a equally <unk> response.
It is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that they all make the same guy, why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a <unk> not a <unk> or social worker, no domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
He was <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my alma mater, me <unk> me to the head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> it with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I am here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> trap, love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor, of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most of my career working for companies of the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I'm driving a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the races, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse -- just happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or <unk> or otherwise in the families, the last place we want or we would expect to find <unk> reason why, domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who stick with it, and I made a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of the 16 and 24 years have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and winter night of January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and started with me with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had <unk> at a college of the <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was very impressed in that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a country in the field.
He had some big <unk> like apples and a hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it on everything at the beginning of a <unk>
And we started out and loved everything from me: which was a list that had gone at Harvard, that I put passion in helping teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York City and to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was entering head in a physical trap and financial and psychological trap <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those guns.
So as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you were supposed to do, I had to feel so safe you bought three legs.
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to the trauma that lived in a small basis.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those <unk> actually were a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious -- every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put up my girlfriend and married my mother and married him.
Even though I had occurred, I was sure that we lived happily <unk> because I loved her, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
I had been a single accident, and I would never make any harm.
I spent twice more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up toward a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that we would <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back on the moon of honey -- went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> he went to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or onus at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control <unk> that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and he was the only person in the world that I could help <unk> to face his <unk>
The other question that everybody is doing is, why don't you simply do not <unk>
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people, because we were the victims, because we knew something that you know, you know, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system for the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time to spend time with the man who <unk> their mother.
And so we still keep asking why isn't it going?
I was able to take it out of one last <unk> he will let me beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone else, to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, all unknown, and I'm here today because you all helped me help me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> women, women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The guilt is it for <unk> as if the victims <unk> deliberately <unk> men who want to be <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also knew that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to you, and they were happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor, of domestic violence very typical domestic violence.
I became <unk> with a cute man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is never come back to you, ever -- it's a gun charged with my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
Right now, as you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, that you're listening to right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting her daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love of particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request toward you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
<unk> increases only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the <unk> to the light talking about it with their kids, their <unk> their friends and family.
It was going to look at their vision of survivors as fantastic people, who have a <unk> future.
You know, <unk> the <unk> signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that there is a very uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have a dress in the room because I'm lucky, and hopefully I brought her clothes out to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> -- less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my mind.
All right.
So why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he would take the back and put it to the kid's hair.
Of course, except with surgery, or a artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, will be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a form of <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to do -- we also have <unk> to a high and <unk> shape and <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to be able to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that they were going to have to see -- they are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> of knowing both of our models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all of the models in New York told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- less than four percent, were not white.
The next question that people always make me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the <unk> of American magazine or the next Steven <unk>
To say that the more you want to be a model is like saying that you want to win the lottery when you get older.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have gotten your studies, and you have a check and some jobs and a few jobs to your backs, no matter what you're going to do, if you want to be president of the United States, but you have your <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people will look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
So this was the first picture that I thought about, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're moving into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not in those pictures.
They are creations of a professional community, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get them to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is to make things for free?
I have too many heel of 20 inches and I never use, except for the last couple of that, but the privilege that I get to do is the real life, and the ones that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> an <unk> agent in order to keep <unk>
It would be <unk> of these privileges the way I am, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their bodies regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who are standing and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, by what for them, is not a matter of <unk>
It's how many times I am <unk>
By doing this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure takes to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer to you is, if you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we have it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with smart creative people.
And that's all the way, but it's just one part of what happens, because what I never say in front of the cameras, is what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group group, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair, but probably the most <unk> women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image of the image of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was good enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> pictures -- and I didn't have the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took random tourists
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife dragged me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk> corner and 5.
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you leave you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to take us the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera into a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk>
So, we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that it had occurred that day that a two-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific trip.
They're also a way to stop in a week in October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always get the same picture, the perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see the life through his eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
And recently, in one of the trips, we were walking around when they suddenly stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store, which was a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> <unk>
And it described me what felt like the five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> he reminded his heart to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So, I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the photo.
So today, I want to encourage you all to come in the picture, and I didn't get closer to someone and asked them, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter. as a stupid thing, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with the <unk> Parliament but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
It's hardly <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in the New World City that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 very high risk of extinction.
So why are we going to be important -- first of all, provide ecological services <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that of not being <unk> and caused large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient African culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and <unk> his life to save the goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they are being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the crux of danger of extinction, -- which means that at less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall from livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there are no <unk> there's been an spread in the number of the Chinese dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb, to <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up in the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this for birds. They cut them by half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to figure out their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so it will focus on a public problem is not going to be <unk>
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to see these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can they help? It can become active -- make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their kids, their neighbors on the <unk>
It's very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it fly without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- but I'm no longer am.  I worked in Zambia, East <unk> Coast, <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> on the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I just about Italians and we decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got with seed <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local and growing tomatoes Italians and <unk> and <unk>
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would give them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were aware that the food in so fertile valley, didn't have had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."   -- time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the morning, about 200 <unk> came up from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only one of us would think that only one of us, the Italians had mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they were doing and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western communities, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It was part of an African woman, the harm that we've done.
So Westerners are <unk> conceptual <unk> and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "I'm just <unk> written by <unk> who said for the whole economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can all -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided for 27 years only to answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you would never have to give anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a coffee. We got together at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we knew what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, but not at the <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what an opportunity have to <unk>
So planning has this point blind.
The smartest person in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't reach their public meetings.
What do we do? We work for you, and we work with face-to-face face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the business doctor, the family doctor in the business of the business of the business -- that it sets up with you in your house, at the table in your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this <unk> junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects forward, and the government came to me to see it, "How can you do that?
So how do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
So I am <unk> and --  So --  So --  So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to speak with you.
You have to give you a <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then we will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you -- more this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, the fossils are not renewable fossils and at one point, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technology to do that.
Who's going to invent technology for the green revolution -- the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a wonderful story that was in a journal <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year.
And in the year <unk> met this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York City wouldn't be within 100 years old.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> -- six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to help address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that supports New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> skilled manufacturers -- <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Michigan.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise, I'm not going to come to speak with you.
And then you have to give you an absolute <unk> devoted service, <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company -- it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can do, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was not born.
We've looked at the 100 Atlantic companies in the world -- <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world are common, only one of them was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone made for this <unk> who talks about this <unk> someone who asked you, what needs you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Okay, so you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't know a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for your <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes to the business stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant wild <unk> that give <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
That always gives the music to the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most infinite number of the U.S. properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
Her death was sudden and was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this has been a deep gratitude for the living time.
He gave it to the most significant things of my life today.
But let's have to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to get to catch the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends, he transformed the wall of this <unk> house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal values in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be <unk>  Before they die --  Before they die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before they died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I have to die I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before they died, I want to die once again."
Before they died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and dreams and dreams and hope for people to laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that one is not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> and it's about giving the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and of remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we made a kit kit and now have been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
We show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very simple, difficult.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that were given to us more power.
If you think about the death -- our life.
Our shared spaces, can reflect better what matters as individuals and more media and more media to share hope, and the people around us, cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
Not speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It shares it to happen what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
You don't care about the religious differences and look at this, never <unk>
When singing the songs of our childhood, I was trying to tell me the words that I didn't even have a thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's <unk> It's very hot.
We <unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four, I pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady party.
It doesn't look amazing?
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though that was the case within it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself differently, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster in the world, there is no cause and <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was very much.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I was pleasure in the very small things, like putting the cars in the row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that there was <unk>
As I grew up more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> is going to be the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that anyone is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and for you, it would have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, I <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift in your inner and, frankly, the search for normality, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communications, who gave a kind of communication to students in engineering.
It was scared.  <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their great unknown words.
But they develop those conversations, I felt what he was going to have had felt felt when he fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door in a new world.
<unk> I felt when I had those conversations with the students' students, they surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges of energy and healthcare and health care -- and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that they do dumb things.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
You can communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
In contrast, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower, that really inspired design.
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then they provide graphs that would give our other senses and believe a deeper sense of understanding what they would expect.
I think these are just a few key keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor for the 19th century, which was a lot better defined when he said, "A <unk> is the one which is looking for a public charge -- no matter or beginning, and that, when she won, he gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was faced at the <unk>
He was thrown into the London Tower and he was placed but had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
You had all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was to be tested quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be King King for a fixed term.
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired <unk> because this debate was going on for three weeks.
She read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
And the <unk> caused the House and <unk> was that the House House was against <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to get rid of power.
They didn't want to be King as if it would give him or her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the more <unk> title and more unfortunate than it came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was already before, but it just meant <unk> that I would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was a bunch of small presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really an insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a <unk> title and childlike as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
Barack Barack Obama is lucky to keep there waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this, I want to tell you, is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, <unk> appearance -- well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the kind of 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of the House -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that you're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
politicians are trying to pick and use the words to shape and control reality, but really really change the reality, the words that what these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the ground in the space of Ghana.
The air is warm and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive tools.
Like the others, I take a cheap <unk> of light on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely see the <unk> branches that they hold the walls of that hole that <unk> the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, that he lost control and dropped a lot of feet on that one.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep on that hole at the risking their lives without paying reward and, often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home but they may never do it because they're prey out of slavery.
In the last 28 years I've been documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Summit of the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was no way in the world, but not as grade.
When we ended up talking very awkward, I was really excited to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how much people don't know?
He asked me a stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer me my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, even considered them my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice the amount of displaced African population during the whole host of slave slaves
150 years ago, the cost of a planned slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, today, you can be enslaving entire families per generations per generations of <unk>
Surprisingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threatening violence and can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by the slaves are value, but those who produce them are disposable they're them.
Now, slavery is almost all over the world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> out of a <unk> <unk> pack bricks in their head, to 18 at the time, to 18 at the time, and take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> for the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over for 16 to 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee enough to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just quite <unk>
And so <unk> was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't the citizenship of that country.
I could put it in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for their liberation and trusted when he was <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks for miles on <unk> land until they were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children in the charge and the children would put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and work 16 or 17 hours a day -- not <unk> because this has been so much of his life.
They have nothing to do with it.
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously had sex <unk>
It took me for a little bit <unk> which would give up this <unk> dirty little <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> like it is known at craft, they are local for forced prostitution,
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember there is a <unk> <unk> fear and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, on the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to labor <unk>
And I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of the silk trade.
This is a family organ.
Black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and they dip the silk into the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
"Not <unk> they were told.
We still hope, but I can go out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest Lake lake in the world.
When we got there, I was going to look fast.
I saw what appeared to be a fishing family in a boat, two older, some younger brothers, some children -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all <unk>
Kids are separated from their families -- <unk> and forced to work with long extensive in these boats in the lake, despite even knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they got to the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like the whole life has been treated with <unk> <unk> tries to be the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when we had the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
<unk> in the cold night.
And you can point that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued by a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorcycle suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
It was asked to take it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then it pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the <unk>
As we started up, we took the <unk> we took the way down, and after walking around an hour we found that the way I was going to go through the recent <unk> so I put up the pictures of photos about my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path, the way he ended up in one of us, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of enslaved.
A lot of women had children strapped to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his little <unk> <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits are up to 90 feet and these people have got a little bit of stone bags that then they will be transferred to another area in which they took the stone to get the gold.
First sight, the site seems like to be full of strong and <unk> but if we look more closely, the margin is going to work at other less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be that this <unk> the victim of T.B. and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When you die his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who force it to be a slave to the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the <unk> and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has to be released and <unk> with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that I'm inspired by a lot respect.
I want to throw a light on the <unk>
They knew their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony of them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to <unk> atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve equal rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I think I don't think about these many beautiful people, which I've had the great honor to meet.
So I hope that these images show up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that the force will turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing the applied math and there is a specific problem for the <unk> we are kind of like the management reports.
No one knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we will see going on.
But <unk> a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain set of dexterity that you can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous ballet dancer dance.
Over the last few years has been made a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there really exists a cure is when we have an objective measuring and <unk>
But it's so frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement can't be <unk> so so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurologic test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do that at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could be done to do ourselves?
It doesn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do with you as a conventional <unk> to a try, you see, in a sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> video of the <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds on the talk, we can imagine as a dance of an vocal piano because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound and all of us have the genes needed -- the <unk> for example.
And like <unk> it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as you go to and how the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
On the bottom plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
They have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both are not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They are both <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests, they are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very minimum cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a low-cost cost of mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> of the patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
With high <unk> we could have objective data.
We could make it a low-cost low-cost cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we have the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> Initiative of Parkinson's disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to deal with these goals.
We have local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with whether or without Parkinson's, it can be under price and leave for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached the six percent goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can do not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very large show of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we are looking at <unk> the confusion of confusion in pursuit of the real markers of disease.
TR: You have a precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on mobile phone web as well, what we did the project. We have an 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms.
We make their family models even more <unk> the perfect skin still even more perfect -- we can do the impossible -- and we will become in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and the photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was happening in Japan.
Shortly after a few time later, an organization where it was <unk> there was the place to work like a part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I went to <unk>
It's a little fishermen around the <unk> <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first peoples affected by the wave.
It reached over 24 feet of height and more than three miles land.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We got rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime down, and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos and cameras and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of villages around the rest of the rest of the world.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
As they went from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything that they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the <unk> toilets, massive <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> pick up the photos.
And there they took them and I had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far beyond myself as my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had washed up the face of the girl I had to get to <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they came for the time and they got more <unk> so this is that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once on the week we use our scanner in the city agencies that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on of the <unk> of the photos.
I could make it for an hour. I could make a couple of weeks.
I could make it for months.
This <unk> had to draw in the way by hand using the areas that color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures -- it would be covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with oil, all of it along with the step of time I continue to <unk> so it was a big part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean -- dry and would have been <unk> for his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures even more <unk>
As he said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was sort of sort of relative to the photos.
I had started <unk> her same but stopped when he realized that <unk> even more.
It was also <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face wouldn't have been <unk> we were able to put the images into a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I collected their photos shared something from their history with us.
A few colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble pretty far away from where his house was born, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her small kids, not as small now, but their two children were at school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took him a week to find her whole family and knew that everyone had survived.
The day he gave him his photos his little son is the least 14 years old.
In spite of all this, these pictures were the best gift that he could do -- something that he could come back to look at, something that he could remember from the past that wasn't marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had come together with us -- <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up more <unk> <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the great majority came to their hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than <unk> 1,000 in teams and materials, most on ink to <unk>
We take pictures.
A photo is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would bring to us, but the first thing we want to look for.
This is the project, of restore little pieces of humanity, of giving someone a connection to the past.
When a picture of a picture is given to someone, a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger with something bigger with something, using their talent for something that won't be thin skin models of the perfect skin.
To finish my email -- I would like to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathered around a baby, and I was excited about a baby, and I was excited because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few our basic needs are the <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> I was inspired by awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet that goes through an apple in a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion to a billion of them per second.
Let me introduce you to a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create video in slow motion from the light moving.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it on and put it into a <unk> <unk> or in a number of <unk> to create a whole package of photons just a millimeter wide millimeter wide away.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a
If you take that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle, how do these photons into this <unk>
What's the kind of light in the <unk> camera.
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> it's what it takes to travel to travel.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
<unk> <unk> this research --  -- <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with an photons package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, and it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going on the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves would travel down the table and because of the reflections of the bottle, you see it at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights will be <unk>
Now, if we take a common and <unk> bullet and we get it to go the same distance and see it at the camera at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see the film?
A day?
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow <unk> movement.
And what about about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that came from the table, the tomato <unk> and the wall wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I was thinking, <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of crap.
But if you look at once more this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light goes on the tomato <unk> it is still bright. It's not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces into its interior, and it comes back after various <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
So why do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a low photo in the exposure, it gets very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than <unk> <unk> so we can barely get some light.
<unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible people.
And if a new power of a future could be allowed to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door to the door, and you get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could get these multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We built.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and you get the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works like that quickly, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances down to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to what is a distance.
So when you put a laser can record a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, but let's take a lot of images like this, and we will pick them up, and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things for us to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that would be <unk> based on what's going on on the curve, there.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through the body, and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue, and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> like a new <unk> <unk> to fix the problems of the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs of photography.
I realized that all of the data scans that we collect every time is not just a scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, I would have liked to see this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes comes in to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can lead a crime against humanity on Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song -- it was <unk> and <unk>
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to come for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering it was looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Put your mobile phone up.
<unk> A Android, a <unk> <unk>
It's a lot. Almost all of us have a mobile phone.
But today I talk about my mobile phone, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35 different information lines.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission put a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This tells you that every single telephone company, every single Internet vendor in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to whom.
And if we use the mobile phone, where do we are.
This whole piece of information is stored at least six months, and until two years, in their telephone company, or their Internet <unk>
And all across Europe and he said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers and Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see a few thousand people who came out to the streets in Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern sell.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time we use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please get me down, all the information they had about me.
I asked them one time, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit that I would have because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we'll give you this information.
At the end of the end, they <unk>
They <unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the U.S.
So I got this ugly one with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand people, 30 lines of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a time I realized that's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what it means to be <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came from City, we did this.
This is a visualization for six months of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see what I'm going to do on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communications network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who's an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I participated in this protest, and if <unk> had known who the leaders, it would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall has never happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and businesses want to store as much information of ourselves as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk>
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not made of fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company -- what information we store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that serves them to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different addresses in the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why they <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It's just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of us to come in.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
Let's take a ride.
Christmas Christmas, you're in the commercial mall, drive in circles for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would get the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood, and my disease had the same initial first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you get them to do it: <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three plus older sisters I was <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents would come to the school system and get rid of the school system, and they would argue that I was also out there, and if I don't know all the ultimate note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
The other approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that we would do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was really strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking around like a boxing champion which has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all the family --  I think no one realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up there was no problems with my faith.
But yet, it seemed to be a lot of a lot about hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so you get the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I learned I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were worried that if not to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would be interested in <unk>
On the summer summer of summer in the summer of my father was <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> sent me warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> me and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before doing yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with, <unk>
And I can see it in your head.
My parents -- this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
And all of me is <unk>
I did all the tasks in the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "The end will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I'm going to be <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the CEO of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, asking him why and she told me that because they thought I could not do the risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for which there was literally born and they gave it a single actor without the cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability papers.
When I came back, I came home and my first tour, it was like extra as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I went there like a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> are not allowed to white, <unk> <unk> with disability.
You just get to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I was <unk>
In my first tour, I took famous cartoon from New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell into the realize that I was at high speed by the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that small rumor that says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York City, in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, and then remind the <unk> principals that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program for the cable <unk> it has Keith <unk>
I walked as if he went to a graduate dance, and I went to a study and sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the desktop of the <unk> and I didn't get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end of I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they didn't go to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
One thing I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that children are <unk> but they never fall away from me or a child and even bigger.
All of a sudden, my disability Internet became <unk> <unk>
I would see online clips with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not to come, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with the media, but I don't think they would be <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be more <unk> in the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we even need the whole society to teach our children.
My workload journey has taken me into very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet -- <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world -- "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was a representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> kids -- a charity to give kids Palestinian refugees.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a young village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
It lives in a little town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> attracted small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it's going to be the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there are no work, no work in future.
He's just living in a tent outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read about a man who offers him to take him to <unk> after dinner to dinner, and <unk>
It was going to be a <unk> of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes -- money to send home to your family.
I show it to a young guy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That child from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist bus, and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist terrorist organization with Al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a kid in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start your future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> that we prescribe riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity to work, in well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities are less than 18 years old.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they didn't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the gate of access to terrorism, to <unk> to be the story of cities Vietnam.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, goes to school.
They don't do pretty much.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being before that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some of the youth leaders in a corporate enterprise.
It was going to be 90 percent young leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the great challenges that the city faces.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me, that because I was a graduate graduate college -- frustrated, was the perfect perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from the point B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> it runs off the local residents who typically couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of your family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool that is the most powerful tool for the <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of the business initiative to do.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> we were <unk> plastic from the overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing up and <unk> and he said that he could survive hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for me, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be businesspeople, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to make it in development and put it out of their business.
And they would get young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from understanding to the creation, and they will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It is to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Its <unk> and this is how it is called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people in businesspeople, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest is <unk>
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not because of the way that we were born, we almost could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful adaptive lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four meters of <unk> with an apple hearts -- <unk> balls, and <unk> old.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up your <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter as a <unk> or where the <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of products, every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his routes and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in trucks. I would <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical mechanical and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very quickly.
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for a number of years, and their bodies were followed by the weight of taking on their body tons of junk every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> collection is one of the most dangerous island of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and enter the traffic all day and pass it around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that they often fall across the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about it <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective day every day, this starts to <unk> their compost and their dangers and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
So we've been <unk> for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have room for what the motors of the economy starts to fail when it's endangered as the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, but I just point their relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed you need.
So with that, I mean just the speed that we used to move used to the <unk>
We don't usually care about it, no longer <unk> or we took our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, we forget them, we forget them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that it would take for it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste collection that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day in the street every day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And his work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way to relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in a form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the streets, I took my little kid and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his <unk> journey like it did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that I started to investigate waste collection and I came back to see that man.
It's called <unk> We worked together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor of labor.
The municipal waste -- what we think when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you -- thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life as a part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally and local traditions.
Today, I had two recent projects like example.
Both projects are located in the emerging world, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the actual work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall in various floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought about was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city that we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores in which people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> lining heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that's about 20 to 25 degrees across the entire year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a bad place for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is the open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was about how to build a New York of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site that is located in a much growth area of the city, where much of the buildings we now see in the image, not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the inputs in the building.
And this spreads out with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the air open in the building that was absorbed by its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do we close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would refer to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped us shape the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> parts, which is the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled by the interior of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the inside of the inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what we want.
But ultimately we knew that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power <unk> for the building in a city in which electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting them on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, they collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I have developed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also his environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 <unk> gates connected by lower lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was we broaden the streets of existing streets, creating 12 similar building blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick up some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the <unk> interconnected with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best guidance for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we put a framework which claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the plant, we have all the connections to our pedestrians.
And they also respond to local norms that make a greater density at the upper levels and a lower density in the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space space in the project is almost like raising the community of the space that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and <unk> and make such a activities like a two miles per morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of the people changes communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> <unk> I was very strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was left time after the <unk> of school -- I was a little evening and hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher at grades.
And then, I did.
It will give you the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few these.
All the way --  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other fellows had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put it all over the side of <unk> and I put myself a row out of it, just because it was <unk>
I'm still shocked what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing that.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get paid.
It's that everything was <unk>
I would never get paid.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I was telling me that this little girl was so small, was so good for you."
I was <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that will be <unk> or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all its possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if I didn't have any <unk> it would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I would have no <unk>
There is no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
You know, the <unk> lists of the school reading <unk> because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> I know it's fashionable -- I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost that they have all of them.
This year is spent 100 years of their work <unk> "In pursuit of the <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from the <unk> <unk> my God, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget how <unk> it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of <unk>
I don't know how it is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, their <unk> are a <unk> narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
So as storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the knife isn't it?
The <unk> do all of the <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could be pleasure to another one, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> picks it on his lover, adds it to his collection of torture in his private chamber.
You have to say that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well in the <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in your <unk> agony of course, listening to the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover, then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you guys think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, a search for truth, a virtuous truth, in fact, to <unk> -- the more agonizing the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these are the <unk> toward the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us fail, causes us to make a lot of feelings and much deeper and vital feelings than a wise man can be able to <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to go look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open to us in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Have any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited for a young woman who was consumed with the idea that his woman is being consumed by the idea that his woman would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get sick in what his wife's did.
So she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or not accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
And novels are very good at this.
And novels really describe how <unk> are made to look at intensity, but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in the way it was completely <unk>
Now I'm thinking about me about eight years old, the <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman from Michigan -- of 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they sent <unk> <unk> to itself, for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to get back to the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What large, even though we do it? Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel by Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and bright character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who try to do <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> their most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to take you out of your self and get it out of what you've ever got, and it's under the floor <unk> your name, it takes your rings, and you have your <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, both like I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good at social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asking for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of the <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I have always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six -- one time you get <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to hold your hands.
It's one of the few times when we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems like this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems like the <unk> like a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same way.
All of a sudden, <unk> can admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to give us the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like plans for <unk>
So as we expect that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It's only fiction <unk> jealousy.
Science used <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary one, Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and descended on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the dark surface -- the <unk> was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work for about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including <unk> crew 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which rose after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do you <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy was going to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Rice at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn to our goal?
And you could also ask, why can it scale the <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly on the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of the technology.
It was because it was really great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technological phenomenal.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and eliminated the <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> was in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
During most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 miles flew 60 miles away as an hour.
From 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism is about the power of the technology has been <unk> when we see that the technology would be solved as to go to Mars, to create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding cancer, or to feed the world population seem to have been <unk>
I remember watching Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't get to the escape <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that of "Anything happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists had <unk> and there were enriched with trivial, trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't mean the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that we have created less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years that they would be created by <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer business for entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas by the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without caring for the risk of <unk> small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital, and that development is long-term capital, not in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems, because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would take a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can be able to compete at the price don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are about what policies and international treaties is developing the development of <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they will not be.
We know for a long time that famines are actually a result of failure in <unk>
But 30 years of research, we have taught that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be a famines while there were bad governments.
And finally, big problems sometimes we have a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war war in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some fiercely resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to find effective and viable treatments.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have and -- but these four elements have to be <unk> American leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: the institutions must support <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the technology for the technology to solve big problems, it does it <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition -- like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like the <unk> system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, it's a very general statement.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a higher idea about the subject.
First of all, the <unk> why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It takes me to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions that could have risen in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion surveys over time, there are no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who have been <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and political -- they follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable 20 years ago, they continue to be quite <unk> judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen citizen is almost half the road.
But is this evidence enough?
What <unk> opinion surveys are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifests when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk>
You're probably going to be able to ask, "To make what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to turn the confidence in a <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a kind of a <unk> officer or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I may, for example, to say that I trust a certain elementary school teacher that I know to give to the classroom, but somehow to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools for measuring the real standard of real trust, because they try to get the good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have any more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it is.
In short, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I believe that those people who have their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I would take their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to work before you trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and others, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will going on in <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and we understand that the education system that is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is making the opposite.
What they do is the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must all know the similar examples.
It was all about the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we would have to be worthy of trust, and they would give them to the people that are reliable and whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
We would have the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the trust.
But the trust, in the end, is because they give them a thousand other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundation enough to trust you.
You've got to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it for all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to figure out that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions -- very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can step over without giving you <unk>
I take them and turn it back and turn it back for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can figure out when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers we've been <unk> we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone more and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that gets steps into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body in the pixel in the pixel so that when the <unk>
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool that's broken down the barriers.
But the two hands stay still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Australian Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We put a little cord transparent to the chambers of depth to detecting the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, the inside of the 3D space, and just grab pixels with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can pick up the book and try to draw lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
We had a lot of us we will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea more far, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical creature.
This imam <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as the users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and control movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> and mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> and stay in the physical world.
You can teach it physically and distance and distance and the famous <unk> by Michael Jordan can play it as a physical reality the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and, and unlike <unk> or textbooks -- this is a real experience, palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what is more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if we discount that barrier, the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes on all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After their surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believe firmly that there was only an accurate path toward the <unk> a safe job and well <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera, Chinese architecture.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
One of the opera singer has to start with <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
And so far, I wrote to the director of the school and the radio radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I was just my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much to train.
My dream is never <unk>
You know, for the rest of my life a second class happiness is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to be <unk> Okay.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books on here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not a moral <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but you know.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it is.
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also gave place to my reading reading habit.
We have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map I thought it was out of place because this is what students in China.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
It's not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields like gender camps and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, the <unk> are economic and politics and spiritual policy.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I will not feel like or powerless before.
Having a broken dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose, and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch my office and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought it could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought me to the <unk> it became easy to just move the head while we get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work after that, then you have children later, until the death goes later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly later, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to Alex to speak about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, it's coming out of the guys underneath his category, it was <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> he said, "No, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they would be, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of <unk> benign problem was a real problem and had real consequences, not only to Alex and his loving life but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, sorry. It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. You know, <unk> <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give their life a way to their life to have 30 and <unk>
People over 40, don't get <unk>
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future couple of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than any other time in life and we know that the female fertility is going to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of the <unk> time.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists would call them names by <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think about when you get the <unk> to a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it wasn't absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting like you or your kids and daughters come to my office, and they say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just killing your time."
Or they say, "Everybody says as long as you start a career before the 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better set the day that I graduated from my mind.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game game.
They were all running, and then at some point around the 30, it turned the music and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one to stay standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but they don't get rid of the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, pick a city, choosing a city, choosing a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are a research that starts to show you, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to the <unk>
The <unk> crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want to do now.
You know that you can't have the child you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see yourself and me, sitting in the room and talk about their <unk> "What was I doing?" What was I thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma finally came to my office because it was in his own words, having a identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or your entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, it was living with a boyfriend, which showed more than the ambition.
And in spite of living a lot of <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they raise her own to say, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> "In <unk> for <unk> <unk>
He was about to the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of hard work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the time that the 1950s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that he would get rid of that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
He didn't know the future of the race of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity creates capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that shouldn't tell you, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma that I would have jobs and I'll tell them to count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar brain limit as much as you know what you know what you know what you know about, how to talk, and where they work.
That new capital of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes out of its nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half not -- and the weak bonds are the way we get into this group.
The half of the work created never <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon get to his family when you have a couple and a form of her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better age to sit on your head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person in which you live now or <unk> now when all on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of only to do to do is work or kill time with anyone who is <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate out of a cousin who worked in a art museum, in another state.
This weak link helped me get a job there.
That business supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events of events in events.
This married one man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter to say, "Now the emergency room of emergency sector are not sufficiently <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles airport that go out somewhere in the west of the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight <unk> on their trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea worth of spreading all the <unk> who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have now the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> his <unk> get an identity, and you use their weak colors, pick your family up.
They don't know what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach you mathematics to <unk> at seventh grade in New York City.
And like any teacher, checking out tests and tests.
I give them assignments.
When the work comes back, I would give grades. grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing that well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible -- and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a different perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you have success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as in competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in neighborhoods -- really difficult -- what teachers still will be teaching for the end of the school and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came a trait like a important success of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not I.Q.
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have <unk>
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and work really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do with my determination questionnaires -- and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination were significantly more likely to be able to get rid of <unk> even when they were <unk> in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the safety of evidence that children were when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at <unk> National <unk> where your vision matters also in school, especially for kids at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop <unk>
What do I have to do to show the kids a robust job ethic.
How do we keep very motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going on with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, <unk> determination is not related to or are even related to the actions of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about develop the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University, for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to be <unk> when they don't believe that this is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to <unk> to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most controversial memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems like the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break this <unk> so that whatever you might want to understand and see the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the drawings of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic <unk> <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to the basic literacy of basic science.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read traffic signals -- <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of the web or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the shape of the called, but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old west <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk>
If a person <unk> your arms, this person is saying <unk> as well.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It is a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
Look at a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree would be pretty idiot.
Remember <unk>
Two together, it's very hot.
Three percent together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a table inside the gate, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women are <unk>
Three women together, have care of <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical -- will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred <unk> which is the same thing as learning a Chinese <unk>
So after the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in this China.
So a sun next to you, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it's a <unk>
This is a slide for remind me that I must stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of an industrial fantasy show of child jobs.
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The really took rise to me 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy who <unk> a metal guy and a kid who was going to get a girl dressed as a guard <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there is a couple of big differences between the <unk> of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz would ever do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the armies of the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the <unk> of Oz is that the most exciting characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Within three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of the surveillance was <unk>  And so they stood in the room and he was struck by the way in the room and was struck by the back and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of value, perseverance and <unk>
So I would have a sense that he was to an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do I make Dorothy the film?
And doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, but not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force of solid capital in the movies for our children, and so little from the way of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that had been served to navigate the world of the adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected the credit to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a little animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but they kids, they are not really their goal.
They do a great job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, and so lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times it continues to look at classic <unk> each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critical criticism when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let it <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted in the root and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist. And in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend of the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do -- in the film, there is more of a female character than I have lines?
So you have to get the requirement.
These women talk to each other.
Their conversations are about something more than the guy who feels so much like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
I have seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis."
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the people to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there is a larger number than this one that is going to put in this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
In the United States, one in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually once in his life.
I don't think it's the <unk> of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think that music music or pornography are intimately closely -- but when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think about is that there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is defeat by <unk> and then charge reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to be <unk>
We have tools for us as a <unk> <unk> and we expect that to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power to be able to keep their power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we need to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter -- what was his favorite Star Trek character -- you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to get them to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where it looked like his job is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked it was to look at fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up with nearly 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my <unk> cookies had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we look at using the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern Delta. of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using <unk> color suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great revival of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles, but somewhere within this enormous <unk>
This area is huge measures about <unk> per mile away.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city on a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly high than you see within the circle here, which we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing working jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of principle, we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation from several hundred years to date from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think it's <unk>
We also find <unk> jobs and <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones used to the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire that was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the greatest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that in the ground.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the <unk> search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
So imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we have a group of <unk> obese in bicycles.
They are competing in a career moving career and they go in direction to their entry door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are <unk> flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the gate,
When you get to the lobby, or what the other side of the door, and you notice the quality of the light, the light's shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you speak.
Can you feel your blue fur, you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you go on to get into the mouth.
They slept by one side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and doing a maximum use of your imagination, you imagine Britney <unk>
He's with time clothes, dancing on his downtown, singing <unk> -- <unk> One More <unk> One <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> way from the oven and from the oven. It comes to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and Len is "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
It was the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize as quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be about nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked him, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques that invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How do I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the competition of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English who is a little <unk> and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What?
Because I would like to show you Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something right?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year that I was not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a guy called <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that can allow us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> movie.
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in the Salt Lake City, <unk> books, was <unk>
And to come back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory of writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin America, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a memory called <unk> <unk> and <unk> wasn't a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed any cognitive too.
As we have no longer need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory -- and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> it's <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University College in London invited a memory champion to the lab.
They wanted to know, be that it has brains in some form of structural sense, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the memory champions and the ones of the control of the control of the control of the control of the <unk>
When they put them on an MRI machine, it <unk> your brains as well as it <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that in memory champions are <unk> different parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in the <unk> competitive is managing as a armed career in which every year someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory champion memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of cards that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits to <unk>
In half an hour.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these competitions, absolutely all of the techniques that we used at the end of the end, you reduce a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox is <unk> <unk> says the next word -- I tell two people you remember the same word -- I tell you -- you know, you know that there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I went back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
What do you do?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said their work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you -- it doesn't have any relationship relationship.
With all the other memories he dance for their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They have good when they come back home to work.
Would you probably have a <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two thousand years in the Greece Greece ...
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring to a <unk> you would go to a poet.
He stood up on the foot, he took his memory of memory, and it was <unk> and as soon as the <unk> room was <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them, but it shattered the bodies called <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they could not be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, closes the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single side here.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory.
If you let me give you the first 10 words of the history that I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be very difficult to do that.
But I would bet that if you let them tell you who sitting on the horse was brown in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember, the more crazy the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the more <unk> it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first treated of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you were invited at the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it for memory, in the same way that would have done it -- if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous image, crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that fully <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind this funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then it goes into the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is like the speakers <unk> <unk> your narratives -- not word for the word that it will confuse but, typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got filled with it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event boring.
Really, it's kind of like seeing a lot of people sitting taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone fell into the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get me in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes, all the <unk> before I sit at the New York Times simply trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was a lot of fun.
I would never have hoped I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is really about doing is better more and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction. is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I'd covered a year before, I had the idea that I could be able to put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good enough for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just as a little <unk> that works that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift -- but it's not the case.
Great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We have to focus on when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even shortcuts.
They work because they make it <unk>
You know, a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to lie down there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and let me tell me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side, will be so <unk> that we didn't even get to process in processing <unk>
I learned about the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, <unk> you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover it in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so we would just give it a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from the <unk> Jersey, and I was six years old, and I lived there at the home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And then everybody was looking at the <unk> so every time I went out of my room to the toilet, everyone was going to come up with me and put wrapped up in a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, because architecture is not about math, not division of areas -- but from those connections, emotional connections, which we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize us.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you might think of, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it in a building and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we have used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments, always have a fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they are going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing round, blood brick that leave <unk> what they need, trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other side of the country, had another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we used the media in the digital era.
It's a new type of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So, how is it that in the same year in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On the one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drives new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the current life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we get away from the people.
All of the black, this tells us, you believe that we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to the other side and <unk>
So we do it, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we do <unk> the <unk> and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and then we have done it in the last 30 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the 1970s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
It's really very hard.
So we are approaching the 1980s, and we started bringing these symbols.
<unk> the next one in the other direction.
We take these ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added fire and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take PET scans, and we turn them into a <unk> which can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes were <unk> won on audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be for French <unk> or the Italian one.
You may have an infinite thing of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we remix memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are feeling frustrated and we started to make <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
You know, <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques, and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic and public science were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and I remember it everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these wild forms, and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because media is <unk> around them and very quickly learned that these shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
And the main mayors in the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennials happened with other new architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
So think, for example, how do they eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
This is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not accurate time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I knew if the one I designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to <unk> because we are on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the elevator or the elevator -- and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> media -- it starts to <unk> faster and faster to be in both extremes of <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can do almost <unk> symbols of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building became the building, it was a part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to reach and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a form of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building would build today, first to the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are already not these mysterious creatures that use words and <unk> words and complicated, and you're no longer <unk> that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, which means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the former city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with based on ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking hole in Miami in Miami -- Florida, also can serve for a sports or for <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> of New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make more green buildings, more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot at play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> space, the local libraries of the local city, the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and she started walking.
And it does it in the very great way, of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
And it gets <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself the big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this, and he asked me thinking, "When did I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit confused because, despite the fact that his mom tells him everything that he is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
The mom that his mom tells you and what his friends, or <unk> they say, you don't know who you believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and asking others to leave a <unk> "I'm a nice or a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager who gets these answers at one of the most vulnerable and emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure on being online and available all the time, speaking, to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never ends.
We never have been so connected, in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There is just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, which is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no divide between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk> <unk>
What is the most important thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news news now.
<unk> of size, still dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique, is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people are compared to.
But the kids are also not immune to this.
Like the <unk> star stars, and the singers who are <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be healthy individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as <unk> to society and the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class.
One out of five are not attending at all the time during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see it good enough, specifically if you don't believe that you're good enough -- <unk> a lower note on the average of your fellow who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it gives it regardless of what these young people.
So to make it well of course, we are talking about you as you see you -- not how you are.
The lower self-worth on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-worth do less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, participating in more diet that are not healthy than they can take them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily, by the people around the surrounding people and are at most risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this so that they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drug consumption -- diets -- aesthetic surgery, aesthetic sexual relationships to the early ages and <unk> damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or not they have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and building their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of software available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that a lot of good programs, without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we must make sure that the program that our children are not only going to have a positive impact, but also an lasting lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical points for anyone to provide an education in body self-worth than work.
An education is hard, but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the <unk> in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
<unk> the status status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the input of our politicians at <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the size of an athlete or the success of an Olympic athlete.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not because you see them.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you, "When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and like companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their own person, valuing the individuality, and diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
It's going to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see that they have never been <unk> to be who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats. What would it mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which would take you out of not having long legs -- more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this, and we would unlock their potential.
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are holding us all together.
But let's give our children the truth.
It turns out that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They would take the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compared to other people.
And we <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, they become consumer agents of change themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> came to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense of Defense <unk>
At the <unk> initially it was what Amy innocent, but being a prisoner for other charges in the company of others, started planning a number of 12 icons from New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United States.
Luckily those plans was <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb from 1993 was in the World Trade Center, couldn't have been.
Later it would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, with a loving mother and elementary school teacher in the two did all the possible for me to give me a happy childhood,
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time for <unk> it doesn't need a lot to get to look at the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in the whole group of human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think that we have to use all the possible means for everyone living as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the weekends of week, he and some friends, they had been doing to throw it on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot at the little orange light on the goal and for all of all, particularly mine, all the goal went out on fire.
My uncle came back to the other and the Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
Of such a father, such son.
And all of all, the comment had been a lot of laughter. but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the parking lot of the North World tower Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was a moment of packing and left another city.
As I was always the new face of the class -- it was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough to <unk>
So most of the time was spent on home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons it didn't have developed social skills, to put it very <unk> and growing under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera, judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in test my way of thinking, it was during the presidential elections, in 2000.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence like me had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, toward the end of the convention, I found that one of the kids we had done friendship, was Jewish in it.
I took a number of days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I felt very proud of being able to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment when I got a summer job in Bush -- <unk> a <unk> park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
My whole life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the point. I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical thing I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy toward suffering from others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it's going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart would make me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative power you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody someday, who is trying to bring violence to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way that even though I was overwhelmed with this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight against terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and the loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, they against those <unk> acts as rejection to my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put me here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which kids don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> <unk> and texture.
Do you feel your body, your <unk> your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that we project in front of your eyes.
And he has constantly a voice superimposed on your <unk>
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie that you, you, you and you.
There is nothing to make them more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I have no certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why aren't we just the robots that we have to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> for nature, is objective by nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective at nature.
Then you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, that vision is <unk>
Creativity is the psychology of the behavior, the <unk> the neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science, <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work in neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness about, questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what it would be?
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offend the <unk>
There's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all kinds of emergent behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work, how they are <unk> and they adapt their living organisms -- they're all questions about how they work.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we talk, all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, really doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientist of heart.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons for granted.
I think we're going to stand at this point.
We have a very cool supply chain, and we had used to this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology -- chemistry explains biology biology, explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
For the other, we don't know how to <unk> that idea to our scientific worldview.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective music movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to me.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that we have, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties don't explain in terms of the most basic <unk>
On the contrary, they think about the world, and that is built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the critical <unk>
In the 19th century, Maxwell discovered that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, mass, mass laws of Newton. So <unk> the electrical charge of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, you can see space, time, time, <unk> then for the question, you have to cut the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, time, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass,
<unk> sometimes they say that we want the fundamental laws so we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, and dogs, the dogs, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of anxiety when they say, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that the photons can have some element of aesthetic feeling feeling some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing -- there's awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness is complex.
<unk> of simple, simple information.
It's very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> took this kind of theory, and developed it with mathematical methods, with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I'm supposed to <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of data, just as significant, degree of consciousness, quite important.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness of zero.
It actually brings a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers are often observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
As Stephen painted, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics, can you leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the <unk> of the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential for <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had not to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think about thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact that the fact of consciousness, but its complexity and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system, in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information, she has a complicated processing processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you find very serious ethical problems about the development of the development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for collective awareness -- the planet.
Canada has a <unk>
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective awareness -- an internal film for this whole group of the whole of the different parts of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that needs to be done.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is the second thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness, we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we finally go to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in the world.
He had a very normal profile. It's a very normal <unk>
I went to school, I was <unk> with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to be a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a ridiculous problem.
She hasn't really gotten anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had good grades. After my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as an achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the middle class, a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like <unk>
And we don't. And it's not the guilt of the boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- in fact, what I do in this <unk> and probably you are waiting for you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to disability.
Yes, you have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability is a remarkable thing.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the child without drawing a pen that was held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would have the disability to benefit people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, that's why my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been related to me to say that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this is going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images that are related to people with disability for people without disabilities.
You're there for you to see them and think that things aren't as bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really hard.
So let's get a few things.
But the things that we do is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was <unk> because I was called the social model of the disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in that because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with kids as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies pulling out the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> is not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> of <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.   <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload the mobile phone on the battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that would be <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold to disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the side of a hole at a hole has never done it becomes a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability isn't exception, but the norm.
I want to live in where a 10-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> didn't consider any <unk> of nothing for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to stand up with the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where you value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade school is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user player.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about it, they think about "Minority <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality will change our lives as well as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run by the game of playing a <unk> <unk> blood beating your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of us, trying to get rid of their own being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take a few videos to show you what the Google looks like, under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface, but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A few <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the soccer field.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the equipment.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more of the feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite <unk> and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> by launching the ball on the <unk> of the network? Or you can do a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when I <unk> the <unk> and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick review on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore was put on a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do this.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> I put radios.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next step here in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You won't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties <unk> like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working.
And all that information comes to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad people will have information <unk>
This is <unk> to the good equipment.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being for <unk>
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you are the <unk>
You get the ball and <unk>
<unk> a open receiver of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you know, that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> Usually they don't get it, but the <unk> system will <unk>
It takes to the protection.
Another <unk> you have a open <unk>
You get the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor is, though, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
They <unk> catching the <unk> runs and <unk>
The public is crazy and fans have followed the way from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to do that lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how they live to be <unk>
How much does it be true for a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do, the choices that we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the southern end of Lofa County -- which includes the <unk> <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> an engineer, chief engineer, to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much for <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it has shown you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free from four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is <unk> bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that don't usually get rid of the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, you have 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer watching his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
So let's take it to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, official veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him with 22 <unk> last year when you get a call from a possible <unk> sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with an officer from the <unk> bridge, <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown over here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown over here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked them if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, I was curious about it, and she opened the box.
And she came up with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk>
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of <unk> guy in New Jersey just had to get his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the great rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had been <unk>
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone would love to be <unk>
What do you find?
What do we say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels feel, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in the very similar circumstances have thought about their life, you've had these <unk>
He would save the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and that never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote me this email just a couple of days, and he's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking, I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike didn't really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the Mike <unk> was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> at the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without having a real mental disease.
It should not be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and go on the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I wrote a radio call by a <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk <unk> near the north.
I took me off the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and half the next, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day to come back on that lane and give it to life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made it <unk> and gave it to hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Are you <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons I Kevin still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious, of all of those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
I had failed debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I went to the General General of San Francisco at the night, you were <unk> like the patient.
I know I did have to get it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, even though their own pain, I'm an opportunity to meet him.
This is what marriage does.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, you wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain out of it.
So the overall way, this is achieved only three things: sleep or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls suicide about the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
And for that time, I was <unk> at three times.
At the end of the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge, and living and that you can talk about it, that one one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the railing leave the railing realize that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us have to do to do to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is no hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you're not from, but in your inner mind, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you <unk>
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had as a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I refer to later, when I look at this photo -- I think, like, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I found that <unk> I'm starting.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value value to get rid of the color of the skin color or by the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo -- what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent in fact, ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was in <unk> at birth because of my genital appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on his head.
And my mom was going, "Why do you always have that t-shirt <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how do you get <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery in the end.
Because of my success, I would never bother sharing my story, not because I thought I will be a bad thing, but why the world is about the people who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, my dad and a family who took me like I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something got me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still about a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you've done in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> And that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and I won a <unk> <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was from queen of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to the provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that I passed my <unk> to the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "Do you know that if you get to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put me two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand about 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do make surgeries more sophisticated and safe surgery.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name -- and the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but to me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York who <unk> who was living his truth, but he didn't end up his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 November we do a global waking percent of <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Of all, thank you first, thank with all my <unk>
And my support network, my parents especially in my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and a few times, when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, he would take my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not. It's not the identity of gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that some times that task doesn't block, and that should have a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, parents generally know for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for your daughter and I'm proud of it.
He started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, and the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you will, a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the history of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when at birth a little girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not overwhelmed and by his father, or by his mother.
The neighborhood comes out, gives her to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first child, the first daughter gets sad.
And when he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he went to her third daughter, it feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only did the mother suffering, but the daughter, <unk> <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and school can bring their siblings.
Until the age of 12 years old, it has a good life.
It can be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes in childhood when it comes to 13 years, you have to get on your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls in their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and his siblings and his family and his family, and if you had the code of that <unk> they could even kill.
And it's interesting that this one of the honor code, not only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of their life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there is a more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the old people even if you don't will.
If you get a guy with a man who doesn't like it, or if he was <unk> with a man who has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was born, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them was able to go to school, and you would be spent two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of <unk> and I was on the relative side to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to see the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
So the <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
He encouraged me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys and kids.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a daily <unk> he wrote a <unk> for the BBC in New York Times -- and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and October October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love to the ear of my wife and "I have to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please do not <unk>
Let's have the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of the truth, for the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right way and God <unk>
These few words are very much for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm good with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please do not <unk>
It was comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women, it's like any 16 years old.
<unk> when they didn't finish their job.
They stand with their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> who has done as bold to <unk> so colorful and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut their wings and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, science science has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you to a brain surgery.
Are you still just like smart or not?
It wouldn't be like that, you can be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that I create important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, for more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if they didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to deal with them to live with life.
Over once I have saved a little.
But luckily, I have a alma soul for what I decided that I would take to try and get the <unk> <unk> because it really doesn't have a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started testing with different mixes -- and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dose of the <unk> dramatically -- my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with the others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and chemical doses for a man of <unk> and I was shocked to see how to fix my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person in the world, and --  -- -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out like an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't.
So I couldn't manage it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to do -- I've been better at the men.
What I was trying to do is to set those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk>
I used to think about almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference, how I can get those images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there is the question of this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works -- for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to thinking about, and <unk>
So after a number of years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really very, very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get fast these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There are incredible possibility with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty in order to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I believe that we are pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image by functional MRI to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at a image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as it was done, looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created by <unk> the contents of the left column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab by Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they looked at their brains to create a great <unk> of brain reactions to the video video.
And then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and while they had a new <unk>
The computer using only brain information scanning it to show you what appeared that the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us <unk>
We're very close to doing that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
And this took place with the brain scanning systems of the most resolution available today, and their resolution has been up to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is open up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Most of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we have to ask, this technology will be the end of the way?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is the only way to get resolution is <unk> but at this point, magnets <unk> only give small improvements at the resolution not for thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than <unk> we make better magnets.
Can we create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make <unk>
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions on <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> frequency of FM radio systems in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, they were <unk> structured patterns that are structured at the frequencies of the <unk> radio.
So when we combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is the dream.
We will be able to write our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few choices to open this door.
Anyway, let's pick it a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it's going to take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet
I think we all have <unk>
His <unk> may be telling some person for the first time or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who is pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to have in your life.
It's a hard conversation -- and even though our subjects can vary <unk> the experience of I've experienced and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> I had a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> I didn't get my armpits, and I quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> of my foot, and I had to stand up my head -- I would say, "Hey, usually a child would say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear as a awkward silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a little bit of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it was <unk>
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You are a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took a deep back and I went down and my backs -- a little girl who had a pink dress looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> mama, just a kid with a question: "Are you <unk>
So I would take it back to again, again, I went from <unk> around it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I saw a boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, as well as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite friends is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all it, they just said, "These are you a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the difficult conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some sessions in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet I am not different about you or yours or yours.
I would give you a hundred reasons for why to go out of my closet it was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared bank in a broken bank is harder to tell you that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to say to your five years than you are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing to have just hard.
We must stop projecting what we're hard to do about how hard for someone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closets and we must only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make you feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the lesbian lesbian for the fight for any four years that would go to coffee.
It was frozen for fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my grenade gay, and the moving one is a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, full strangers I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you will kill you."
One of my most memorable launches was in the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests knew it was gay, and by doing my <unk> lady on my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one of the tables and finally came to one where my parents' friends, people who knew me was years old.
And after talking to a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of going to show you desperately his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using me?"
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to tell where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we want.
So this is how hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask anyone with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep doing what I like to call the three principles of the <unk> <unk>
Now, please see this through the prospect gay perspective, but understand that what involves going out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others needs to know that we do suffer.
Number two: <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents who may be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important -- let the complex stuff.
You communicate their truth.
I would never get rid of that.
And some of you can get hurt secure, <unk> for what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark problem: a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of it is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical thing to the pioneers of computer like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are of an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth of the Earth, you would see that to develop a physical theory that explained how to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that will be able to get the surface of a planet, they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems like to be carefully carefully for development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of economic states that we prescribe the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for a number of years, there is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can get from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strong strength, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, and yes, up to an imminent time <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like it to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep our choices open.
And so having to account with this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
Would the intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I'm thinking, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy long-term entropy in any system that you can find inside.
<unk> <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal tests to play human intelligence, and they even make money <unk> actions, all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided for his mind to balance <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for global robotics and human care technologies.
This ability use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing away on opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic development and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we have successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keep the network right on.
This same network of network can also have applications in healthcare, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, which we found successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated set of actions, successfully increasing assets under their economic management.
This ability for risk management will have tremendous applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the first term of the term -- the <unk> work, there was always the concept that if they were smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion that if you were smart machines.
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals about this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint light intensity of the stars when planets go around in front of them, and they jam a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets on our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the time, this gives me clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure trove of worlds that are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The hottest year was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice -- which have been with us from a millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused global scale have come over the global scale of our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the quest for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, demonstrated this by a mission as the Kepler is.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface in pursuit of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> the <unk> like the <unk> atmosphere, they take samples from the atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> remind us of our planet, and places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas, and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the expansion of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left by <unk> places that are really <unk> -- compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm by the colonization of Mars and other planets drag it with a great and sad amount of <unk> the implication and the belief that we have to wait for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly <unk> the Earth.
For a lot of me like the <unk> exploration, I'm deep directly with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the captain of Titanic will be later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and climate preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces in the hostile areas of the land, we may be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years, the physicist Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi asked me to have to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, an possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the origin of the planets is that we have this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we will save us from ourselves, but human preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to address the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
And a few years ago, I was <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight in Europe in the next morning, and I took my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but they don't have more expensive than a half a half night, so I thought that even though the circumstances, I was very stopped.
I'm a career neurologist and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rate -- will go down the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in your place, which was going to make bad things happen.
Or at least if it happens, if you get bad things that will be <unk> the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe in the core.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked about the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective thing.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> like explaining <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, it was a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to be tracking the location of the important things, where the fish are all the fish, where the fish are the ones that live trees -- where the tribes and the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if somebody actually did the experiment if someone really did the experiment, they cut it out of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move so much, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason for losing car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home I would take a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular objection is in it.
To their reading glasses -- a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with it -- your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a phone phone a picture of your credit card card, you're going to be able to drive, passport, you're going to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain frees up.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So some of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful than when you faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of their medical decisions, and in fact for social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to get would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack to the heart, stroke,
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even as you might know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for which most doctors don't want to talk, and companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or play a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
Number one must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the guilt of the doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help an person?
300.
This according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I was <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include physical pain <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember under stress don't think clearly.
So think of how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug -- right? A person has taken them five percent of the 300 people have <unk> that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be <unk> by the drug that you can help you drug drug.
I'm not saying it or not to take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethics requires, is a part of the informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that you do more than the older men in 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has gone in.
And the side effects in that case is produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before time the questions that you can make that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain into the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face of the face with a predatory system, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or your immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is kind of rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail to do that.
The idea is to think about the future of how they might be those <unk> to put the systems into the place that will help minimize harm or to avoid the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the door, with a key to the entry door in the way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't heard of, and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to be <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be, I will never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over the decade of 1800, and at the time of time, it mixed with the local lines, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound of that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It will be <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you don't mean <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound that's for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It keeps it going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have some notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do the self with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come in my territory of art.
It's going to become more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and focus on my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound of the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the social currency, social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was something a person listener.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose it to <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of the society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same way and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, I work and institutions, work with a lot of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value on something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium in the music of the music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express all of the paper.
And the same thing can be said to a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor at the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into a lot of different parameters, different ways.
If we <unk> a different parameter for every finger while you play piano, like facial expression, the movement, the body movement, the body movement, the shape of the hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear, English language, as if it gets <unk> only one key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a situation -- you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of clear or idea.
If only one key would change the situation would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters you can be able to express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
Almost, oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and it would take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of the <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you get it <unk> and <unk> the speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel like the same thing can be true.
"All tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one -- it gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, a dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> hand <unk> <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with high hands.
Now we're going to do that as much in your head as the chest, and as well as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs across the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have a social value.
We have to start questioning what the social value defines and allow <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, and I don't have to hear music to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I would like to <unk> your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you look at everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other people.
Over time, I am now an adult and teaching citizens and invention in the middle school, Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, you know, the beaches, and no, it's not eating alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we collect those chunks of plastic to actually look at the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous fish.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work for the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are very cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are very excited about the robots.
Then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it turns out the lights and web cameras and <unk> in a floating robot that is slowly moving through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see those chunks of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
It was going to be on a website on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they are trying to be trying to fix them immediately.
I was looking at my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, only using the hands of the world in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where they live in the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown the mud and the oil also are brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be driven through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
<unk> I looked at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe even tackle a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I am half Japanese and French half and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it made several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power station close to the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is gone, the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has a safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've been back to <unk> every year from the accident and research in other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we reported the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take a serious job, but they did because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all your life.
Along with them we discussed the <unk> data, that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the summit of the mountain towards the <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition the nearest <unk> to the date.
We get closer to five miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen aid in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea of the sea with a chip of sediment as we invented and we built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the jump and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turn it into the largest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, can be built almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair into new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen scientists, creators, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other I needed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
<unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information that was required by every cell to work and to make it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and manufacturing production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects, to think of their objects, as <unk> parts of different parts of different ways.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You act primarily like <unk> the other mainly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality by variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthetic analysis -- it shows on the two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and coming to the growth.
You probably ask yourself, why do you now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a very special moment, where we were doing four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we had never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools across scales, in scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base, which someday not to print <unk> buildings and graphics made from <unk> genetically altered that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where every opening is size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner, too.
And that designers have access to this analytical analytical for the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the same way, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to nature for <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern -- it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a Jewish house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what it matters.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree, it would have no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land has made trees grow trees with twigs, cortex, water and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects made it out of a <unk>
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of tree of the tree of the tree -- with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> in the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons to produce every year for organisms like shrimp, and crab, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune their property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from <unk> hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot was able to vary the properties of the material and create these structures made of a single material for a long material -- 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves it dry to find a natural way to the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process that were used to contain <unk> <unk> that came up for the first time on the planet making a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture basically carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems with <unk> <unk> and if it grows even more to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects that are designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for the <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> board, we did our own table, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology, like liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
And in our first piece of clothing, we had two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
A light turns into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a only channel that looks like the tract of <unk> that will help you get these bacteria and to make their function as well.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, and they will make the properties of the material of material according to the functionality that is <unk>
If we wanted more <unk>
This <unk> system, when it stretches out of one end to another, it is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer camp and 10 times more than our own little <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels -- bright channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are dead creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we prescribe our skin, our heart tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer does it 3D <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture within which it was <unk>
<unk> will not be <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, comparing those fibers to each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first turns into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not inside a box, we realized that it was a flat, flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> it was transmitted directly through the environment.
You often have the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to the most dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
And so we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, and color worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked <unk> of silk to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they would put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much faster.
<unk> Fuller said the tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
Al <unk> biological silk about <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion through their integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, it was <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of the design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two views in the world.
What it takes us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of the creation, that brings us from a inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time, that we make ourselves in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when you first asked this?
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and the art and the arts and then he was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was struck by something else, something that's totally different, and I was excited about it, and I will get me to absorb and feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to move on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why I had so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad for me for not <unk> at all.
I was worried that I was afraid of commitment, or being overwhelmed or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
It will be <unk> where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to make things.
Let me tell you where the <unk> they learned about the culture.
You know, ask us, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question makes us over and over again as we grow in a different way, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what makes us sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream about what they might be, not inspired to dream of everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, but even a good thing -- maybe you're going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All the ones you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling that every one of us has something to do what you spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
This is a breath that I say.
It could help if you divide three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would make the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance time, the ideal was the fact that I was good at <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara refers to us as <unk>
You know, whatever they like or <unk> you or <unk>
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or <unk> that you have to win.
But what I've learned to talk about with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there is huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared on cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates artificial <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
And then the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can be able to get a lot of these points of intersection.
The second factor, <unk> is hard learning.
When the <unk> are interested in something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid to test new things and come out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we need to do, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and independent man.
As a child girl, <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she is the fastest known as this.
Before it became writer, <unk> was a huge financial decline.
He had to learn the most thin retail mechanics when they started their practices, and this ability to write the compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a waste of time to get to what you can do -- even if at the end of the end of it.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is the adaptability. That is the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other digital pages, sometimes riding from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, as James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to meet the market needs to be the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging them to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not to deal with them in front of them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> the belly knowing that, because they wanted to be Jackson <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The doctor can dive deep and put on ideas, and <unk> provides a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them will tell them to just be more like their <unk>
I once said that, if there is one thing that you take from this talk, I hope that it is this: <unk> with inner <unk> whatever.
If you're a heart specialist then, you know, all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just had to realize is one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Let's see the intersections.
<unk> our internal <unk> leads to a more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a glimpse and found strange and weird plates in the brain of a guy who never had seen before.
The most amazing thing is even more amazing.
If we had been living today, we could have been living today, we could not give her more help than the one that he did -- he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But shortly has been made on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I am a part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live at 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you have to spend their years to have Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or to be dear with Alzheimer's.
In America, health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs per five times in the year by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases, because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer that in Alzheimer's disease, despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and because of a annual number of deaths as cancer.
The lack of resources is due to one more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everyone else -- Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, everybody, even scientists, <unk> with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduction significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these silent dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the <unk> are left in the outside.
So this makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of which block is complex, as a bomb.
You can do a cable <unk>
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that it is done, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we have managed to identify a critical step in the process. You are now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy <unk> and you can see it <unk>
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick with each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see it <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's a real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we can calculate it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have mastered more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry and <unk>
That was essential to move in HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, <unk> of their loved ones day and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article on the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is a spiritual study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience when I tried to test it as a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions more and more and more and more and then you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would die for another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that are increasingly <unk>
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to or her, I know very honest at this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a little detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited everything from the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But nonetheless, and --  -- and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column of the column for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I suppose some of you probably ask, keep together <unk>
And the reason I think that's question this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
One week before the paper was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually only from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few different backgrounds.
And that came up with a good burden of attention into a relatively new relationship.
But it didn't have a clue.
The article was published on a Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had been called <unk> Today and Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million views, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing very carefully about own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has international news --  and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it, or I was writing what they did every day for weeks, always, they were doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and weird strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is a part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called <unk> for San <unk> which included the experiences of readers when we test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was really <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that both of us did a public onset together.
He <unk> interviews, and he refused orders for two of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really was, if I was able to make love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to respond.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if they were going to go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there was the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were felt more close after doing a number of the later protocol as well as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it among people in opposite people.
The original version of the story, which I tested last summer, and that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this article -- but unfortunately it never happens.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk about a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would fall from the person who you do it.
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did get better known to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which was probably my first adult life, and he was my first true love, and he had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I went to the science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I only looked for the book that I was writing for, but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I built up with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I felt like then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what we would expect.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for, is sometimes more than reasonably likely to demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is an <unk> not just about being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> from the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some sort of mitigate the <unk> and this is a very scary story because they fall in love to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the history that asks, still follow together?
And his content with an answer with a Yes or No.
So more than a question, you know, let's ask more questions, questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things go <unk> and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more controversial conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. Love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no considered everything that a choice was supposed to do.
It didn't mean how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how many times it will have to keep that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't think of.
And what we <unk> and what maybe will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy ending implicit in the title of my article which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian full mountain, and in a way, I got a <unk> in the forest.
 One of the city in New York makes a while.  So something really affected me, but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you put it a ticket for a dollar, a pen and a fork in one place in Colorado.
And I thought that some <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our sort of <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At one point, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and doing and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered in <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I put more <unk> on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it was the opposite of it, somehow it looked like it grew up as size, as if it was to play the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that I could find on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow -- I can flow like this, and I can flow like you do about a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, we will be able to make an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very much fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and stuff, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of the natural size of human beings in layers.
It was cool, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that they put together a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something really big -- which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot in "The garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with the heads of animals travel between two worlds.
You're going on the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh where you get <unk>
So here is where creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists to suicide mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the Osama
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a mythological being that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a 5.5 percent tail.
Anyway, his tail turn on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made from punch cards.
They have <unk>
It was made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It takes me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
And each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material or magazine or magazines.
But each of you acting as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being stuck inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's <unk> it can be <unk>
I will accompany you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills that go out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little ice scene inside the chest <unk>
Can you be <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a radio, a musician, a <unk> arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world -- and a garden.
We put the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries of the borders, the religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweet and <unk> we all are going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have effect against pain, first passes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective, and <unk> system so that any drug is going to be in your body.
The <unk> though, is the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs that serve the amount of viruses in blood, and you will increase the heart of stem cells.
But they are also known by their side effects on its world, because in time that they take it to the current -- you get <unk> and worse for the time that they take it to their fate, which is where it's more important, in the <unk> of HIV.
These are regions in the body like the nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it cannot easily be in the blood flow of patients that are <unk> to regular drug therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the <unk> of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great deal of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life that is oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "You know, make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you used to be used in <unk> for wounds and surgery, they can be used for anything else, including the transport transport of drugs.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, which opens up and closing the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam and <unk> laser on the cell membrane that these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser passes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice the hole is <unk>
We're testing this technology in vitro or in <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes into the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> <unk> we store it directly in the site, as the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They're going to do what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent involvement to the confrontation not violent.
I do work work, in the world of politics and <unk>
Understanding these groups is key to solving most conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be an dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons why they do it, but no one is looking at what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and policies are not armed with it.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, the <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military system.
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> met by their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking
It was going to be a complex machinery of communication, radio stations radio channels and websites and Internet websites and strategies in social media.
And here's the magazine <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
Living groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but by using business -- for example, construction companies.
These are a key thing.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also make something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they run hospitals, they put their professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state didn't develop security and protection.
The rise of Taliban in an Afghan Afghanistan -- the war or even the beginning of the <unk> <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means to fill a void, a divide, gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood by the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in <unk> gaps by government, and emerge like groups, and political groups, participating in the violent struggle and provide governance.
And the more complex and the more complex are these organizations, we can have a little bit less like it to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, and they run all their function, collect the garbage, you run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and we live in a world of <unk> nations and hybrids and the more weak states, like in the Middle East today, more accurate, and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the digital tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to set up and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we'll understand what incentives will offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not <unk> the military power can make some battle, <unk> but not to give peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that security vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> label would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was excited about as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a little bigger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and hate sex. Like if that was bad.
Today, I see what are the women all around the world and anger, in particular, looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-worth and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman, and it can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It was the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we need to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social skills, skills and so much more.
We need to have the difference and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap music to all volume.
Although the letter degrades to the women and <unk> deep -- the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin <unk> <unk> is amazing.
Do you really get your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
You know, poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical evidence.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is everything I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines, and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies about the fairy tales, which make you happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
And the conventional Feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women, the workers, gay workers, and <unk> and <unk> for white, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good Feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist player.
It also happens this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put memory in a <unk>
We hope that we would turn it right.
When we get older, we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think of that <unk> before you try to put in there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be <unk> as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what it means to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to achieve <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call them, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist story.
In <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show of <unk> looking at this star of the pop star embrace the feminism and to make young men and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started arguments if it was <unk> it was not quite feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go so much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more well, one feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from to recognize our <unk> to give them the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a living supply of it.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until they make it change affecting the change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are allowed to allow it to be more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant and also very brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
And where they were excited by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is going to be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio radio when we listen to songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, to be in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't have a number of enough women, both to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people in the people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they will be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to be including more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
We are no longer <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little courage of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, people in the power of the power and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a meaningful and meaningful change.
We can also tell the courage with the courage -- good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist is not to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you about everything, because the old voice was to me, and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
And a few kids would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
It was going to be my voice, and after everything I didn't bother to believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like mine, and they knew what meant living in this world if you have brown skin.
The words of women who showed me that wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also found that if it was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I was my <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad generalization I'm a good generalization I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I mean and what I do, without abandon everything that makes me human.
I hope that we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California had measles to have been visited by being visited -- or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that measles that can be terrible for a child with an immune system, is one of the most readily disease in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism, and vaccines were <unk> and marked by being an fraud fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory that is causing autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children with autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism, considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and assume that I had heard about her create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence followed a stable only three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control from Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic -- and a better detection detection to explain these figures <unk>
But that kind of language not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his two-year-old son.
If the diagnostic criteria they had to do -- why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find out before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism, and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist I read Leo Leo at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun for hours by waving for their hands on their faces, but they were prey from panic for <unk> like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
The base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, I declared that there were seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome, while they would make <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is really no wonder, because the <unk> criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving up that diagnosis of children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of 10 children sent for other doctors to his doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of sexual <unk> caused by cold, cold lives.
These kids, he said, they have been very carefully at a fridge that I don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents -- desperate to make their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a U.S. cognitive psychologist. I thought the theory of mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as no support services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his fellow Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years ago.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the fact of the autism actually was much more <unk> and diverse people.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of <unk>
So in other ways, these kids didn't go into the little frames and <unk> like <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one didn't realize these children before?
But then I was <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article -- and then he turned down, buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I stopped <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he did it for her.
The paper is offering a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a boarding school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, <unk> described as disability for life that required forms of support and <unk> spaces during the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients called the <unk> their little teachers, and he took them to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disabilities.
He believed that autism, and autistic features were common, and they always been, looking at aspects of this continuum of <unk> <unk> in the pop culture like awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that he was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked as a silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that they called the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide and inclusive.
These changes didn't fell in a <unk> broken <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked with me to reform these <unk> people all over the world to see a autistic child for the first time.
Before I was going to come up with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, I knew about experts knew what it was like autism, but after the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards from the <unk> <unk> psychologists and parents all over the world knew what it was.
At the same time, they were introduced first clinical tests to use to diagnose autism.
It wasn't supposed to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a net effect on the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same way they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were expected to be out there, making the people with autism, and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a simple, <unk> history as bad as <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the preventing one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are connected on the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles is to solve for new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate strains of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with it doesn't mean it's broken up.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Certainly people are struggling to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, and parents to support, and parents with the potential for their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover for <unk> the <unk> <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
