It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House --  we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville.
Driving ourselves.
I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but --  I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there.
